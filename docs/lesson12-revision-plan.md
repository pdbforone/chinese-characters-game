## Theme & Narrative Structure

### Title

**"The King's Golden Balls"**

### Saga

**Empire** — Part of the imperial court narrative arc

### Theme

The King introduces a new game to his world: jade balls that fit perfectly in the hand. Over tea, the meeting descends into madness. The Emperor arrives, logic flees, and only the Lord of the Eastern Province remains sane — immune to gold, copper, and fishing attempts at bribery. The King's frustration culminates in inscribing a warning on a nail.

### Memory Palace

**The Royal Pagoda Game Hall** — A magnificent pagoda where the King holds court, introduces his jade ball game, and watches his entire kingdom descend into competitive madness. The journey moves from introduction → tea and meeting → the game unveiled → madness spreads → the Emperor investigates → the sane Lord resists → bribery attempts fail → frustrated inscription.

### Callback

- Lord recalls Dynasty from Lesson 3
- Copper recalls Shellfish from Lesson 4
- Dog returns here as crazy companion

### Narrative Arc
