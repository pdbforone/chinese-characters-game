## Official Narrative Story

From `lesson_stories_prose.md`:

> First, there was a **TREE (木)** — singular, vertical, reaching for light. Then **WOODS (林)** — two trees became companions. Then the **FOREST (森)** — three trees became a world. Someone had thought **TO PLANT (植)** order here. They failed.
>
> **APRICOT (杏)** trees grew everywhere — sweet, fragrant, absolutely stupid. They were **DIM-WITTED (呆)** — mouths open, vacant stares. Many had already **WITHERED (枯)** — too foolish to find water. A **VILLAGE (村)** huddled at the forest's edge. The villagers traded with the trees. They depended on **ONE ANOTHER (相)** — humans and apricots, mutual incompetence.
>
> A student came with a **NOTEBOOK (本)** — determined to document this oddity. It became a **LEGAL CASE (案)** — who owned these ridiculous trees? The answer: **NOT YET (未)** determined. The **LAST (末)** owner had died laughing at an apricot's joke. His grave was marked with **FOAM (沫)** — the trees' attempt at flowers. The **FLAVOR (味)** of the fruit was indescribable — sweet and baffling.
>
> The old man's **YOUNGER SISTER (妹)** came **TO INVESTIGATE (查)**. She sifted through the **SEDIMENT (渣)** of his life. The trees had tried **TO DYE (染)** his burial clothes. They used plum juice. The **PLUM (李)** trees were only slightly smarter.
>
> She found his **TABLE (桌)** still set for dinner. **AS IF (若)** he had expected to return. **GRASS (草)** grew through the floorboards. His notes spoke of **SUFFERING (苦)** — the taste of wisdom in a stupid world.
>
> The forest was **WIDE (寬)** — endless, in its dim-witted way. Each **LEAF (葉)** held a question no one thought to ask. **NOBODY (莫)** understood the trees. Nobody tried. The sister tried **TO IMITATE (模)** her brother's research. She wandered until the forest became **DESERT (漠)** — trees giving way to sand.
>
> She found **A GRAVE (墓)** she didn't recognize. Beside it grew a **SEEDLING (苗)** — small, determined, possibly less stupid than its parents. She bent down **TO AIM (瞄)** her attention at this tiny hope.
>
> _Maybe the next generation would learn. Maybe the forest would wake up._
