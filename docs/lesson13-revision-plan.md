## Theme & Narrative Structure

### Title

**"The Lotus Car Chase"**

### Saga

**Journey** — Part of the travel and pursuit narrative arc

### Theme

The Tao (Way) is usually peaceful, but today it involves a speedy car chase. Someone has stolen a lotus flower from the temple, and the pursuit exceeds all safe limits. Each driver has their own pattern of madness as they race through summer heat toward inevitable fall.
