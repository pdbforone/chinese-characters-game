## Narrative Summary

The most dangerous weapon in the precinct wasn't the gun — it was Officer Chen's poetry book. His deliberately terrible verses have become a legendary interrogation technique. Criminals surrender rather than endure his recitals, and judges condemn defendants just to end his performances. The precinct learned that the written word can be more powerful than any weapon — for better or worse.

## Memory Palace: The Police Precinct

The journey through Officer Chen's precinct:
1. **Evidence Room** — Books and drawings preserved as evidence
2. **Desk Area** — Scratched poetry verses, attack plans
3. **Interrogation Room** — Deliberate failures, rescue attempts, reverent criminals
4. **Main Hall** — Spacious emptiness, words spoken
5. **Captain's Office** — Police commendations, criminal plans
6. **Prison Wing** — Cells and condemnations
7. **Training Room** — Instructions and talks
8. **Poetry Corner** — Poems, language, reading materials
9. **Exit** — Final tuning of voice, discussions, departure

- Paper, books, and written documents as recurring motifs
- Contrast between the seriousness of police work and absurdity of poetry weapons
- Speech bubbles, sound waves for spoken word characters
- Prison bars and official seals where appropriate
