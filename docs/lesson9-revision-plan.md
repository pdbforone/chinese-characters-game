## Official Narrative Story

From `lesson_stories_prose.md`:

> The journey measured **A LI (里)** — then another, then a thousand. The **QUANTITY (量)** of distance was meaningless; only commitment mattered. They would **BURY (埋)** the entrance after you entered. No going back. Inside, everything was **BLACK (黑)** — the color of secrets, the color of ink. Your eyes adjusted to find **SPOTS (點)** of lesser darkness. **BLACK INK (墨)** was the only substance allowed. You drank it. You breathed it.
>
> To attend was **TO RISK (冒)** everything: eyesight, sanity, the surface world. Yet they all came. They were the **SAME (同)** — seekers of the hidden word. The **CAVE (洞)** went deeper than geography. **ORIENTATION (向)** was a memory. Which way was up?
>
> Here, scholars gathered **TO ESTEEM (尚)** one thing only: the written **CHARACTER (字)**. They **GUARDED (守)** texts too dangerous for sunlight. Their task: **TO FINISH (完)** copying the forbidden manuscripts. This was **REALITY (實)** — more real than the kingdoms above.
>
> Heralds would **PROCLAIM (宣)** when a new text was complete. All work happened at **NIGHTTIME (宵)** — in a cave, there was no day. Despite the darkness, they were **PEACEFUL (安)**. The ink calmed them. The great **BANQUET (宴)** came once per year. Invitations were sent **BY MAIL (寄)** — black envelopes, black ink, black wax. Only the **WEALTHY (富)** could afford the journey. Those who returned learned **TO STORE UP (貯)** what they had learned — hidden, protected, waiting.
>
> _In a cave buried a thousand Li away, knowledge eats itself and grows stronger._

## Neo-Gongbi Image Prompts

### Template Applied to Lesson 9 Characters

Each prompt follows the 5-step structure from the prompting guide:

#### 里 (lǐ) - a Li

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting a lone traveler counting their steps across endless terraced fields at twilight.

The figure pauses where rice paddies meet bare earth, a bamboo counting staff in hand. Geometric field plots stretch to the horizon in horizontal layers, each one representing a li walked. The packed soil path continues into mountain shadows. Exhaustion and determination war on the traveler's face.

The composition arranges terraced fields above packed earth to subtly evoke the Chinese character 里, as if the very landscape was shaped by generations of travelers wearing this pattern of distance into the land.

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, earthy ochres and faded malachite greens, subtle ink washes for mountain mist, visible silk texture. Contemplative exhaustion, heavy grounding. No visible text.
```

#### 黑 (hēi) - black

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting the moment of entering absolute darkness — a cave mouth swallowing all light.

A figure stands at the threshold where the last rays of fire-light meet impenetrable shadow. The cave interior reveals nothing — pure obsidian absence. Torch flames flicker at the boundary, their warm glow consumed by cold black. The figure's silhouette becomes indistinguishable from the darkness they're about to join.

The composition arranges fire-light below and darkness above to subtly evoke the Chinese character 黑, as if the cave entrance itself was carved in the shape scholars use to mark "black."

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, cinnabar flame against deep ink blacks, layered washes creating impossible depth, visible silk texture. Transformative threshold, sustained tension. No visible text.
```

#### 墨 (mò) - black ink

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting scholars drinking ink from ceremonial bowls in a torch-lit cave chamber.

Figures in dark robes raise black bowls to their lips, ink staining their mouths. An inkstone the size of an altar dominates the center, freshly ground ink glistening. The cave walls gleam with condensation that might be water, might be liquid ink. Everything exists in shades of black and near-black.

The composition arranges the black inkstone above earthen cave floor to subtly evoke the Chinese character 墨, as if the very act of ink-making was enshrined in this shape for millennia.

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, pure lamp-black ink with subtle gradations, minimal cinnabar highlights on lips, visible silk texture. Ritualistic intensity, sharp ceremony. No visible text.
```

#### 洞 (dòng) - cave

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting a cave passage where underground streams merge into identical channels.

Water flows through darkness, each stream finding the same path as every stream before. Stalactites drip in unison, creating ripples that mirror each other perfectly. The cave walls curve inward, suggesting depths beyond geography. Seekers walk alongside the water, their reflections indistinguishable from each other.

The composition arranges flowing water beside the cave passage to subtly evoke the Chinese character 洞, as if water itself carved this character into stone over countless ages.

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, azurite blues for water against ink-wash stone, atmospheric depth, visible silk texture. Cool mystery, commanding echo. No visible text.
```

#### 安 (ān) - peaceful

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting a woman seated in meditation beneath the curved ceiling of the ink cave.

She sits perfectly still on an ink-stained cushion, her dark robes merging with the shadows. The cave ceiling arcs protectively overhead like a roof. Despite the absolute darkness surrounding her, her face holds profound serenity. Other scholars work around her, but she exists in a bubble of stillness.

The composition arranges the cave-ceiling above the seated woman to subtly evoke the Chinese character 安, as if the very architecture of peace was designed around a woman finding sanctuary.

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, soft gradations of ink-wash, subtle mineral whites on her face, visible silk texture. Profound serenity, sustained calm. No visible text.
```

#### 宴 (yàn) - banquet

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting the annual ink banquet in full celebration within the great cave hall.

Long tables stretch into darkness, laden with bowls of ink and manuscripts. Scholars feast on knowledge while women serve fresh-ground ink from massive stones. Torch-light creates a false sun overhead. Faces gleam with ink-stained joy, the only celebration permitted in this realm of eternal night.

The composition arranges the torch-sun and feasting women beneath the cave-roof to subtly evoke the Chinese character 宴, as if this moment of celebration was eternally inscribed in the shape of banquet.

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, warm cinnabar torch-light against cool ink shadows, festive energy within darkness, visible silk texture. Sharp celebration, commanding joy. No visible text.
```
