## Neo-Gongbi Image Prompts

### Template Applied to Lesson 9

Each character gets a prompt following the research guide:

#### 里 (lǐ) - a Li

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting a weary traveler pausing on a mountain path at dusk.

The figure stands where terraced rice fields meet bare earth, counting steps with a bamboo staff. Behind them, geometric paddies stack in horizontal layers while the packed soil path stretches forward. A milestone marker shows the distance walked—the land itself becomes a measuring instrument.

The composition arranges fields and earth to subtly evoke the Chinese character 里, as if generations of farmers walking these paths wore the very shape of distance into the landscape.

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, earthy ochres and malachite greens, subtle ink washes for twilight atmosphere, visible silk texture. Contemplative exhaustion. No visible text.
```

#### 黑 (hēi) - black

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting a charcoal kiln at the moment of perfect combustion.

Fire rises from earthen walls, transforming wood to pure carbon. The kiln's interior glows with contained heat while its exterior remains dark as obsidian. Smoke spirals upward, carrying particles that will become ink. The boundary between flame and earth creates absolute blackness.

The composition arranges fire, earth, and resulting darkness to subtly evoke the Chinese character 黑, as if the kiln itself was built in the shape potters have used since antiquity to mark "black."

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, deep ink blacks against cinnabar flame, layered washes creating depth in shadow, visible silk texture. Transformative intensity. No visible text.
```

#### 洞 (dòng) - cave

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting a mountain cave where an underground stream emerges.

Water flows from darkness into light, the cave mouth a perfect opening in the rock face. Inside, stalactites drip in unison, each drop the same as the last. The stream carries the mountain's secrets outward, its surface reflecting the identical shapes of surrounding stones.

The composition arranges water and cave opening to subtly evoke the Chinese character 洞, as if the stream carved this entrance in the pattern monks recognized as "cave" for centuries.

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, azurite blues for water against ink-wash stone, atmospheric mist at the entrance, visible silk texture. Cool mystery. No visible text.
```

#### 安 (ān) - peaceful

```
A contemporary Neo-Gongbi painting on sized silk depicting a woman meditating beneath the eaves of an ancient workshop.

She sits perfectly still, sheltered by curved roof tiles that arc protectively overhead. Incense smoke rises in a single unbroken line. The space around her holds absolute stillness—even dust motes hang suspended. Her presence transforms mere shelter into sanctuary.

The composition arranges roof and figure to subtly evoke the Chinese character 安, as if the very architecture was designed to embody peace when occupied by one who seeks it.

Rendered with fine-line gongbi technique, soft mineral whites and pale azurite, delicate ink lines for roof tiles, visible silk texture. Profound serenity. No visible text.
