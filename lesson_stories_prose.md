# LESSON 1: The Mouth That Counted the Universe
**Saga: Genesis** | **Characters: 15**

In the beginning, there was nothing but a single horizontal line, until a hungry Mouth appeared.

---

**ONE (一)** — a single stroke, alone in the void. It had no name, no purpose, only existence.

But loneliness breeds multiplication. The line split, and there were **TWO (二)** — parallel, equal, staring at each other across the emptiness.

They looked up, looked down, and decided they needed a bridge. **THREE (三)** appeared — the first staircase in creation, climbing toward something none of them could name.

Then came enclosure. **FOUR (四)** built walls around itself, the first container, the first secret. Inside those walls, things could be hidden. Inside those walls, things could be counted.

**FIVE (五)** was a crossing, a meeting point where the first roads intersected. Travelers who didn't exist yet would one day pass through here.

A lid descended. **SIX (六)** covered the mysteries below, a roof over the growing world.

But now, trouble. **SEVEN (七)** slashed across creation like a blade of lightning — the first violence, the first cut. The numbers trembled.

**EIGHT (八)** split apart in response, two paths diverging, the first choice, the first separation. Some things would go left. Some things would go right. Nothing would ever be whole again.

**NINE (九)** curled into itself, a hook, a question mark. *Almost*, it whispered. *Almost complete. Almost enough.*

And then: **TEN (十)**. A cross. A completion. The universe had counted itself into existence.

But who was counting?

A perfect square opened in the void: **MOUTH (口)**. It had been watching all along. It spoke the numbers. It *ate* the numbers.

The Mouth tried to swallow Ten — that perfect cross — but choked. It coughed, and from its lips flew light.

**DAY (日)** burst forth — a window to a blazing sun, the first morning.

**MONTH (月)** followed — a crescent moon, softer, marking the passage of something new called *time*.

The Mouth looked down and saw **RICE FIELD (田)** — a grid, a garden, something that could grow. Something that could feed.

And finally, in the still water of that first field, the Mouth saw its own reflection: an **EYE (目)** staring back.

*The universe blinked. It was awake.*

---

# LESSON 2: The Ancient Singer of Dawn
**Saga: Genesis** | **Characters: 16**

*Callbacks: Daybreak recalls Month from Lesson 1 • Stomach recalls Eye from Lesson 1*

Before there was music, an ancient fool with wild whiskers opened his mouth and invented singing.

---

He was **ANCIENT (古)** — older than stone, older than memory. He had been alone so long he'd forgotten why.

So he acted **RECKLESSLY (胡)**, without thought, without plan. What did he have to lose?

"**I (吾)**," he said aloud, testing the word. "I am."

But being alone is not the same as being. He needed a **COMPANION (朋)** — two moons standing side by side, sharing the same sky.

When the companion arrived, something happened. The darkness between them grew **BRIGHT (明)** — sun and moon together, illuminating what had been hidden.

And in that brightness, the ancient one opened his mouth **TO SING (唱)**. The first song. Tuneless, formless, but *alive*.

The sound scattered into the darkness and returned as **SPARKLING (晶)** light — three suns dancing, crystal reflections of that first pure note.

Other beings emerged from the void, drawn by the music. They brought **GOODS (品)** — three mouths speaking, trading, wanting. Commerce was born.

Where there is trade, there is growth. The world became **PROSPEROUS (昌)** — two suns rising, warmth spreading.

But the singer had started too **EARLY (早)**. The morning sun still hung low on the horizon, not ready for all this activity.

So they waited for the **RISING SUN (旭)** — proper dawn, the sun climbing its throne of clouds.

One **GENERATION (世)** passed. Then another. The singer grew old, but his song did not.

His **STOMACH (胃)** growled — that field inside his belly, demanding attention. Even creators get hungry.

At **DAYBREAK (旦)** — sun balanced on the horizon's line — he finally ate.

And then something strange happened. His hungry belly roared so loud that the earth itself bent: **CONCAVE (凹)** in some places, **CONVEX (凸)** in others.

Mountains and valleys. The first geography. All because an ancient fool was hungry for music.

---

# LESSON 3: The Emperor of Measurement
**Saga: Empire** | **Characters: 18**

*Callbacks: Tongue recalls Eye from Lesson 1*

The Emperor loved himself so much he tried to measure his own tongue.

---

It began with **ONESELF (自)** — a nose pointing at its own reflection. The Emperor could not stop looking.

His robes were **WHITE (白)** — pure, unblemished, the color of perfection. Or so he believed.

He counted his virtues and found **HUNDRED (百)** — one hundred reasons to adore himself.

He bathed in **SOAP (皂)** made from the rarest oils. Even his cleanliness was superior.

He stood in the **MIDDLE (中)** of every room, every map, every conversation. The center of all things.

His subjects numbered in the **THOUSANDS (千)** — a multitude that existed only to admire him.

But then came the challenge: measure the **TONGUE (舌)** that spoke such perfect words.

He tried using a **LITER (升)** — too crude. The tongue is not liquid.

He commanded it **TO RISE UP (昇)** — but tongues do not fly on command.

A physician offered a **PILL (丸)** that would make measurement possible. The Emperor swallowed it.

He consulted **DIVINATION (卜)** — the court oracle with his magic wand.

The oracle began **TO TELL FORTUNES (占)**: "Your tongue measures... infinite. You are perfect, Majesty."

The Emperor floated **ABOVE (上)** his throne, the pill taking effect. "Yes!" he cried.

Then he sank **BELOW (下)** it. "Wait—"

Up and down. Up and down. Stuck between heaven and earth like a **CARD (卡)** wedged in a slot.

The court physician called it **EMINENT (卓)** — a profound medical achievement, really.

The **DYNASTY (朝)** would remember this moment.

Mostly because everyone began **TO RIDICULE (嘲)** the floating Emperor who could not measure his own tongue.

---

# LESSON 4: The Shellfish Economy
**Saga: Empire** | **Characters: 18**

*Callbacks: Shellfish becomes the currency that buys Tribute in Lesson 5*

In this strange land, money isn't gold; it's stubborn shellfish.

---

There was **ONLY (只)** one currency that mattered here.

**SHELLFISH (貝)** — those stubborn, beautiful creatures of the sea. Pry them open, and you find pearls. Keep them closed, and you have a coin.

The merchants would **PASTE (貼)** them everywhere: on contracts, on doors, on their own bodies.

Those with many shells were considered **CHASTE (貞)** — pure of intention. Poverty was suspicious.

Every **EMPLOYEE (員)** was paid in shells. They clinked when they walked.

They learned **TO SEE (見)** the world through shell-colored glasses.

At the **BEGINNING (元)** of each month, the shell-counters would tally the wealth.

Every transaction was recorded on a **PAGE (頁)** — leaf after leaf of shell-debt and shell-credit.

Some shells were **STUBBORN (頑)** — they refused to open, refused to be spent.

**ORDINARY (凡)** people couldn't afford many. Their tables were plain, their walls undecorated.

Only those with **MUSCLE (肌)** could dive deep enough to find the rare ones.

Many were **DEFEATED (負)** by the shell economy. They owed more than they could ever repay.

Debts were distributed **UNIFORM (勻)** — everyone owed equally, no exceptions.

Failure to pay resulted in a **SENTENCE (句)** — ten days in the debtors' cave.

A **DECAMERON (旬)** of darkness, counting shells in your dreams.

The guards measured your crimes with a **LADLE (勺)** — one scoop of justice, served cold.

The shell-lords sat at the **HEADS (首)** of great tables, shells piled like mountains before them.

They never missed. Every investment hit the **BULL'S EYE (的)**.

*And somewhere in the depths, the shellfish waited — silent, stubborn, holding the world's wealth in their clamped mouths.*

---

# LESSON 5: The Workshop of Blades
**Saga: Craft** | **Characters: 23**

*Callbacks: Sword here will arm the Army in Lesson 14*

The Older Brother set up a shop to sell tools, but he only knew how to make things sharp.

---

Everything in his workshop was **STRAIGHT (直)** — honest edges, true angles, no deception.

He had come here **TO SET UP (置)** a new life. The family business had no room for second sons.

Every **TOOL (具)** he made was functional. Hammers, saws, planes. But they bored him.

What he wanted was **TRUE (真)** — a purpose that matched his nature.

**THE WORK (工)** filled his days. Sawdust and sweat. Calluses and cuts.

His **LEFT (左)** hand held the wood. His **RIGHT (右)** hand guided the blade.

He began **TO POSSESS (有)** a reputation. "The brother who makes things sharp."

Officials came with **BRIBES (賄)** — shells from Lesson 4's strange economy.

They wanted weapons. They brought **TRIBUTE (貢)** from the Emperor himself.

Every **ITEM (項)** in the order was specific: swords, daggers, spears.

First, the **SWORD (刀)** — curved and hungry.

Then the **BLADE (刃)** — that edge where steel becomes light.

He taught himself **TO CUT (切)** with precision. Seven materials. One stroke. Perfect.

The Emperor learned of his skill. A messenger was sent **TO SUMMON (召)** him to court.

His talent became **EVIDENT (昭)** — bright as the sun on polished steel.

But with recognition came **RULES (則)** — regulations, restrictions, red tape.

He was appointed **VICE (副)** of the Imperial Blade-works. Second in command. Second again.

He ranked **FOURTH (丁)** among the Emperor's craftsmen. A nail, hammered down.

The court mosquitoes loved **TO STING (叮)** newcomers. He was no exception.

But none of that mattered. What mattered was this: he **CAN (可)** make things sharp.

And so the **OLDER BROTHER (哥)** became a legend — not for his station, but for his craft.

He stood at the **CREST (頂)** of his art, looking down at all the dull things still waiting to be sharpened.

---

# LESSON 6: The Child Who Roared
**Saga: Family** | **Characters: 12**

*Callbacks: child recalls Older Brother from Lesson 5*

The second child was not good; in fact, he was a piercing headache.

---

He was the **SECOND (乙)** — hooked like a fish gut, bent like trouble.

But he was still a **CHILD (子)** — small, incomplete, full of potential.

He discovered a **CAVITY (孔)** in the garden wall — an opening to a world his parents didn't control.

Through that hole, he learned **TO ROAR (吼)**. Not a cry. Not a whimper. A *roar*.

His parents wish they had stopp**ED (了)** him earlier. But completion comes too late.

His mother was a **WOMAN (女)** of patience. Bent gracefully, like water around stone.

She believed he would become **GOOD (好)** — woman and child together, in harmony.

"You'll grow **TO BE LIKE (如)** your brother," she promised. "Strong. Respected."

The **MOTHER (母)** fed him, clothed him, endured him.

But this child had no interest in being like anyone. He wanted **TO PIERCE (貫)** through expectations.

His **ELDER BROTHER (兄)** — the one from the Workshop of Blades — tried to teach him discipline.

The child watched, roared, and learned **TO OVERCOME (克)** every obstacle they placed before him.

*Not by obedience. By force of will.*

---

# LESSON 7: The Battle of Stones and Rays
**Saga: Elements** | **Characters: 20**

*Callbacks: stone and Gravel foreshadow the Mountain in Lesson 23*

A small stone decided it wanted to be a large sun.

---

It was **SMALL (小)** — insignificant, overlooked, stepped upon.

It had **FEW (少)** admirers and even fewer friends.

When it tried to speak, its voice was **NOISY (吵)** — grating, irritating.

The sun, by contrast, was **LARGE (大)** — vast, warm, the center of everything.

The stone sharpened itself to a **TIP (尖)** — small on top, large on bottom. Ready to pierce.

Each **EVENING (夕)**, it watched the sun descend and dreamed of rising.

There were **MANY (多)** evenings like this. Years of evenings.

Finally, the stone had **ENOUGH (夠)**. It was time.

It rolled **OUTSIDE (外)** the cave where it had rested for centuries.

It demanded a **NAME (名)** — something other than "small stone."

Its body was **THICK (厚)** — layers of compressed time.

It remembered: it was no mere **STONE (石)**. It was ancient.

It looked at the **GRAVEL (砂)** around it — lesser stones, shattered things — and felt pity.

"I will do something **WONDERFUL (妙)**," it declared.

It began **TO RESEMBLE (肖)** the sun — concentrating heat within itself.

It tried **TO PEEL (削)** away its outer layers, hoping to reveal light beneath.

For one moment, it emitted a **RAY (光)** — a single beam of borrowed brilliance.

But it was **OVERLY (太)** ambitious. One ray is not the sun.

The stone learned **TO ECONOMIZE (省)** — to save its light, to glow gently.

It became something **STRANGE (奇)** — not a sun, but something the sun had never been.

*A stone that dreamed. A stone that almost shone.*

---

# LESSON 8: The Flood and the Fire
**Saga: Elements** | **Characters: 46**

*Callbacks: Sand recalls stone from Lesson 7*

The Water and the Fire had a truce, until the River got drunk on Juice.

---

The **STREAM (川)** flowed through **A STATE (州)** that had always obeyed the water's will.

To live by the stream, you learned **TO OBEY (順)**. There was no other way.

**WATER (水)** was everything here. Life. Death. Law.

It had existed for **ETERNITY (永)** — long before memory, long before names.

The stream had one **REQUEST (求)**: to return to the **SPRING (泉)** where it was born.

It crossed the **FLATLANDS (原)** with this single **WISH (願)** driving it forward.

Then the rains came.

Water began **TO WASH AWAY (沖)** everything in its path. Towns. Temples. Memories.

Those who could **SWIM (泳)** survived. Those who couldn't became part of the current.

The flood carved a **CONTINENT (洲)**, reshaped **MARSHES (沼)**, scattered **SAND (沙)** across former kingdoms.

The great **YANGTZE (江)** swelled with pride. **JUICE (汁)** from crushed orchards mixed with the surge.

The **TIDE (潮)** came in. The tide refused to go out.

From this chaos, a new **SOURCE (源)** emerged — water finding its level.

Life became **LIVELY (活)** again, then threatened **TO EXTINGUISH (消)**.

The **SITUATION (況)** was dire. Every **RIVER (河)** and **LAKE (湖)** was in revolt.

None could **FATHOM (測)** how to stop it.

**SOIL (土)** tried to hold the line. It measured each wave with **EQUAL (均)** desperation.

The earth's **BELLY (肚)** filled with water.

Workers tried **TO FILL IN (填)** the breaches.

The land tried **TO SPIT (吐)** the water back.

**"WAAAH!" (哇)** cried the villages, one **CHINESE INCH (寸)** at a time disappearing.

The elders tried **TO SEAL (封)** the rivers with prayer.

In the **BUDDHIST TEMPLE (寺)**, monks sat in meditation. **TIME (時)** meant nothing to them.

Then came **FIRE (火)**.

It rose from the south, turning water to **ASHES (灰)**.

The survivors were **VEXED (煩)** — which disaster was worse?

**INFLAMMATION (炎)** spread — two fires stacked, angry and hot.

Where fire and water met, things became **THIN (淡)** — watery, bland, exhausted.

**DISASTER (災)** seemed endless.

But then a single flame learned **TO ILLUMINATE (照)** instead of destroy.

In the calm waters that remained, **A FISH (魚)** appeared.

People began **FISHING (漁)** — the first meal after the catastrophe.

The legendary **YÁO (堯)** brought **FEVER (燒)** to cook what was caught.

And at last, **DAWN (曉)** broke — fire and water reconciled in the morning light.

*The truce was restored. Until the next time someone got drunk on juice.*

---

# LESSON 9: The Black Ink Banquet
**Saga: Craft** | **Characters: 24**

*Callbacks: Nighttime recalls Month from Lesson 1*

In a cave buried a thousand Li away, they hold a banquet where you eat only ink.

---

The journey measured **A LI (里)** — then another, then a thousand.

The **QUANTITY (量)** of distance was meaningless; only commitment mattered.

They would **BURY (埋)** the entrance after you entered. No going back.

Inside, everything was **BLACK (黑)** — the color of secrets, the color of ink.

Your eyes adjusted to find **SPOTS (點)** of lesser darkness.

**BLACK INK (墨)** was the only substance allowed. You drank it. You breathed it.

To attend was **TO RISK (冒)** everything: eyesight, sanity, the surface world.

Yet they all came. They were the **SAME (同)** — seekers of the hidden word.

The **CAVE (洞)** went deeper than geography.

**ORIENTATION (向)** was a memory. Which way was up?

Here, scholars gathered **TO ESTEEM (尚)** one thing only: the written **CHARACTER (字)**.

They **GUARDED (守)** texts too dangerous for sunlight.

Their task: **TO FINISH (完)** copying the forbidden manuscripts.

This was **REALITY (實)** — more real than the kingdoms above.

Heralds would **PROCLAIM (宣)** when a new text was complete.

All work happened at **NIGHTTIME (宵)** — in a cave, there was no day.

Despite the darkness, they were **PEACEFUL (安)**. The ink calmed them.

The great **BANQUET (宴)** came once per year.

Invitations were sent **BY MAIL (寄)** — black envelopes, black ink, black wax.

Only the **WEALTHY (富)** could afford the journey.

Only the **RICH (富)** could afford to disappear for so long.

Those who returned learned **TO STORE UP (儲)** what they had learned — hidden, protected, waiting.

*In a cave buried a thousand Li away, knowledge eats itself and grows stronger.*

---

# LESSON 10: The Forest of Dim-Witted Trees
**Saga: Nature** | **Characters: 32**

*Callbacks: younger sister recalls Older Brother from Lesson 5*

Not all forests are wise; this one is full of dim-witted apricot trees.

---

First, there was a **TREE (木)** — singular, vertical, reaching for light.

Then **WOODS (林)** — two trees became companions.

Then the **FOREST (森)** — three trees became a world.

Someone had thought **TO PLANT (植)** order here. They failed.

**APRICOT (杏)** trees grew everywhere — sweet, fragrant, absolutely stupid.

They were **DIM-WITTED (呆)** — mouths open, vacant stares.

Many had already **WITHERED (枯)** — too foolish to find water.

A **VILLAGE (村)** huddled at the forest's edge. The villagers traded with the trees.

They depended on **ONE ANOTHER (相)** — humans and apricots, mutual incompetence.

A student came with a **NOTEBOOK (本)** — determined to document this oddity.

It became a **LEGAL CASE (案)** — who owned these ridiculous trees?

The answer: **NOT YET (未)** determined.

The **LAST (末)** owner had died laughing at an apricot's joke.

His grave was marked with **FOAM (沫)** — the trees' attempt at flowers.

The **FLAVOR (味)** of the fruit was indescribable — sweet and baffling.

The old man's **YOUNGER SISTER (妹)** came **TO INVESTIGATE (查)**.

She sifted through the **SEDIMENT (渣)** of his life.

The trees had tried **TO DYE (染)** his burial clothes. They used plum juice.

The **PLUM (李)** trees were only slightly smarter.

She found his **TABLE (桌)** still set for dinner.

**AS IF (若)** he had expected to return.

**GRASS (草)** grew through the floorboards.

His notes spoke of **SUFFERING (苦)** — the taste of wisdom in a stupid world.

The forest was **WIDE (寬)** — endless, in its dim-witted way.

Each **LEAF (葉)** held a question no one thought to ask.

**NOBODY (莫)** understood the trees. Nobody tried.

The sister tried **TO IMITATE (模)** her brother's research.

She wandered until the forest became **DESERT (漠)** — trees giving way to sand.

She found **A GRAVE (墓)** she didn't recognize.

Beside it grew a **SEEDLING (苗)** — small, determined, possibly less stupid than its parents.

She bent down **TO AIM (瞄)** her attention at this tiny hope.

*Maybe the next generation would learn. Maybe the forest would wake up.*

---

*[Stories for Lessons 11-55 continue...]*

# LESSON 11: The Dog Who Cried Peach
**Saga: Family** | **Characters: 18**

*Callbacks: Dog returns as a crazy companion in Lesson 12*

A remarkable dog discovered a portent: the sky was raining peaches.

---

It began with a **PORTENT (兆)** — cracks in the sky, whispers in the wind.

Then came the **PEACHES (桃)** — falling like sweet, fuzzy rain.

The **POOCH (犬)** saw it first. He was **REMARKABLE (尤)** — sharper than other dogs.

He sat in **SILENCE (默)** for a long time, watching the fruit fall.

This was a **SORT OF THING (然)** that had never happened before.

Then he began **TO CRY (哭)** — not from sadness, but from the weight of knowing.

The villagers grabbed every **UTENSIL (器)** they could find to catch the peaches.

But the dog was **STINKING (臭)** — he'd rolled in something foul that morning.

The other **DOGS (狗)** avoided him. Even the peaches seemed to fall elsewhere.

The villagers grew **TO DETEST (厭)** him. His smell. His crying. His knowing.

**PRESSURE (壓)** mounted. Someone had to explain this miracle.

The **COW (牛)** stepped forward. She was **SPECIAL (特)** — the village oracle.

She began **TO DECLARE (告)**: "This is a sign! A **VAST (浩)** change is coming!"

Everyone listened. Everyone except the dog.

He remembered what came **BEFORE (先)** — the last time peaches fell.

So he went **TO WASH (洗)** himself in the river, preparing for what was next.

*The cow could declare. The dog would prepare.*

---

# LESSON 12: The King's Golden Balls
**Saga: Empire** | **Characters: 27**

*Callbacks: Lord recalls Dynasty from Lesson 3 • Copper recalls Shellfish from Lesson 4*

The King introduced a new game to the world involving jade, tea, and insanity.

---

The King wanted **TO INTRODUCE (介)** something new to his **WORLD (界)**.

Over **TEA (茶)**, he announced a **MEETING (會)** of all nobles.

"I have created a game," he said. "It will **FIT (合)** our greatness."

"**HA! (哈)**" laughed the court. They assumed he was joking.

From the tallest **PAGODA (塔)**, the **KING (王)** produced two **JADE (玉)** spheres.

"Behold — the **BALLS (球)**!"

He **PRESENTED (現)** them to the court. The nobles began **TO PLAY (玩)**.

Within hours, everyone had gone **CRAZY (狂)**.

The **EMPEROR (皇)** arrived to investigate. His robes were **RESPLENDENT (煌)**.

All nobles were required **TO SUBMIT (呈)** their scores.

The **WHOLE (全)** court was consumed. Even **LOGIC (理)** had fled.

Only the **LORD (主)** of the Eastern Province remained sane. He refused **TO POUR (注)** his attention into the game.

The King tried bribery. He offered **GOLD (金)**.

Then **COPPER (銅)** — cheaper, but still shiny.

He even tried **TO GO FISHING (釣)** for the Lord's interest.

Nothing worked.

Finally, the King threatened him with a **NEEDLE (針)** — torture by acupuncture.

Still nothing.

The King hammered a **NAIL (釘)** through the game board in frustration.

On it, he carved an **INSCRIPTION (銘)**: "This game will destroy us all."

Then he sat back, suddenly **AT EASE (鎮)**.

*Some games are meant to be lost.*

---

# LESSON 13: The Lotus Car Chase
**Saga: Journey** | **Characters: 20**

*Callbacks: Car from here races again in the Army's transport in Lesson 14*

The Tao (Way) is usually peaceful, but today it involves a speedy car chase.

---

The **WAY (道)** stretched forward, endless and true.

A guide appeared **TO GUIDE (導)** travelers through its mysteries.

But today required something **SPEEDY (迅)**.

Someone had begun **TO CREATE (造)** chaos along the path.

Guards were sent **TO PATROL (巡)** the roads.

Others preferred **TO STROLL (逛)** — too slow for today.

Then came the **CAR (車)** — wooden wheels screaming on stone.

**ONE AFTER ANOTHER (連)** they appeared, chasing something precious.

A **LOTUS (蓮)** flower had been stolen from the temple.

The thief was **IN FRONT (前)**, wielding **SHEARS (剪)**.

The guards tried **TO TRANSPORT (輸)** themselves faster.

Their speed began **TO EXCEED (逾)** what was safe.

**EACH (各)** driver had their own **PATTERN (格)** of madness.

A **GUEST (客)** from the capital joined the chase, his **FOREHEAD (額)** gleaming with sweat.

It was **SUMMER (夏)** — the hottest day of the year.

Someone mentioned **L.A. (洛)** — a distant city where such chases were common.

The lotus thief began **TO FALL (落)** behind.

*The way is peaceful. But sometimes the way requires speed.*

---

# LESSON 14: The Soldier's Dream of Capital
**Saga: Empire** | **Characters: 23**

*Callbacks: Crown recalls Dynasty from Lesson 3*

The superfluous army marched toward the capital, carrying nothing but a dream.

---

They were **SUPERFLUOUS (冗)** — an army that no war required.

Their thoughts were **PROFOUND (沉)** — sinking deeper than their footsteps.

The **ARMY (軍)** moved as one, their armor catching **RADIANCE (輝)**.

Each soldier had something **TO CARRY (運)** — a dream, a promise, a reason.

They imagined the **CROWN (冠)** that awaited their general.

This was their **DREAM (夢)** — to witness triumph.

They crossed **PITS (坑)** and valleys without complaint.

The **TALL (高)** mountains did not stop them.

They learned **TO ENJOY (享)** the journey itself.

Their boots became **RIPE (熟)** with dust and memory.

At each **PAVILION (亭)** they rested, their faces **SHINING (亮)**.

Finally: the **CAPITAL (京)** appeared on the horizon.

The air grew **COOL (涼)** as they descended into the valley.

The **SCENERY (景)** was exactly as the old songs described.

They would arrive **AT ONCE (就)** — together, as brothers.

The **CIRCUMFERENCE (周)** of the city walls took a **WEEK (週)** to walk.

Every **SOLDIER (士)** was counted. Every name recorded.

The **LUCKY (幸)** ones would be presented to the Emperor.

They could finally **BUY (買)** supplies — real food, clean clothes.

Street vendors rushed **TO SELL (賣)** them everything.

*The dream was the journey. The capital was just where it ended.*

---

# LESSON 15: The Police Poet
**Saga: Spirit** | **Characters: 22**

*Callbacks: Prison here foreshadows the Prisoner of Lesson 26*

The most dangerous weapon in the precinct wasn't the gun — it was Officer Chen's poetry book.

---

He kept a **BOOK (書)** in his pocket at all times.

His other officers made **DRAWINGS (畫)** of crime scenes. He wrote sonnets.

When bored, he would **SCRATCH (劃)** verses onto his desk.

Most cops **ATTACK (攻)** problems directly. Not Chen.

He had learned to **FAIL (敗)** beautifully.

**DELIBERATELY (故)** bad poetry was his specialty.

He once tried **TO RESCUE (救)** a hostage with a haiku.

Criminals had learned **TO REVERE (敬)** his terrible verses.

His office was **SPACIOUS (敞)** — nobody wanted to share it.

When he began **TO SAY (言)** anything, people fled.

The **POLICE (警)** department kept him for one reason only.

He could create **A PLAN (計)** that no criminal would expect.

His record of **PRISON (獄)** sentences was perfect.

Judges would **CONDEMN (討)** criminals just to end his recitals.

His **INSTRUCTIONS (訓)** were legendary. "First, we read them poetry."

"Then, **THE TALK (話)** begins."

His **POEMS (詩)** were weapons of mass confusion.

His **LANGUAGE (語)** was technically Mandarin but emotionally illegal.

Criminals would **READ (讀)** his verses and surrender immediately.

He could **TUNE (調)** his voice to maximum cringe.

"Let us **DISCUSS (論)** your crimes," he'd say, opening his book.

"**THIS (此)** will not take long."

*No criminal ever returned to his precinct. The poetry was that bad.*

---

# LESSON 16: The Iron Burglar
**Saga: Craft** | **Characters: 20**

*Callbacks: War here ends with the Politics of Lesson 17*

A burglar with a style all his own decided to steal an entire city made of iron.

---

His **STYLE (式)** was unmistakable — theatrical, absurd, impossible.

Every heist was a **TEST (試)** of physics.

He carried a **HALBERD (戈)** — impractical, but impressive.

"Steal gold **OR (或)** steal glory," he said. "I choose both."

The **BURGLAR (賊)** had one target: the Iron City.

Its gates were **LADEN (載)** with ore from a thousand mines.

Every surface was **IRON (鐵)** — walls, floors, fountains.

The gardens were **LUSH (茂)** with metal flowers.

The city had begun **TO TURN INTO (成)** something beyond architecture.

The **CITY (城)** was alive, in its iron way.

Its builders were **SINCERE (誠)** in their madness.

Guards of great **MIGHT (威)** patrolled constantly.

Many had tried **TO DESTROY (滅)** the Iron City. All had failed.

**EVERYONE (咸)** knew its defenses were perfect.

To even attempt theft would **REDUCE (減)** a man to nothing.

The burglar made **A LIST (單)** of everything he wanted.

This would not be theft. This would be **WAR (戰)**.

But wars cost **COINS (錢)**, and his motives were **SHALLOW (淺)**.

In the end, he stole one thing: a **CHEAP (賤)** iron nail.

*Sometimes the greatest heists are the smallest ones.*

---

# LESSON 17: The Political Footstep
**Saga: Journey** | **Characters: 22**

*Callbacks: Foundation here becomes the Base of Lesson 45*

Politics is just a series of footsteps that lead nowhere correct.

---

First, you must **STOP (止)**.

Then take a **FOOTSTEP (步)** forward.

Then you must **FORD (涉)** a river of paperwork.

**REPEATEDLY (頻)** you will be asked to compromise.

You must **AGREE (肯)** or be destroyed.

Everyone is **LOOKING FORWARD TO (企)** your failure.

The **YEARS OF AGE (歲)** pile up like fallen leaves.

The **MILITARY (武)** waits in the wings.

Every **LEVY (賦)** is contested. Every tax questioned.

The **CORRECT (正)** path is never the obvious one.

**POLITICS (政)** is a game with no winners.

You must **SETTLE ON (定)** something eventually.

You learn **TO WALK (走)** through minefields.

Those who **TRANSCEND (超)** the game rarely survive it.

Those who **SURPASS (越)** expectations are feared.

The question is not who you are but what you **ARE (是)**.

Every **TOPIC (題)** is a trap.

Those who **BUILD (建)** empires watch them crumble.

Those who **PROLONG (延)** their reign invite assassination.

The **NATIVITY (誕)** of new ideas is always bloody.

Only **CLARITY (淸)** of purpose survives.

Only a solid **FOUNDATION (基)** endures.

*Politics is walking in circles. But some circles are larger than others.*

# LESSON 18: The Day the Sky Wore Clothes
**Saga: Elements** | **Characters: 72**

*Callbacks: Rain and Thunder return as the Flood memory in Lesson 24*

Someone had to dress the sky, and only one tailor was foolish enough to try.

---

It began with **CLOTHING (衣)** — a single garment, stitched with impossible ambition.

**INSIDE (裡)** the tailor's workshop, **GRIEF (哀)** hung like dust.

His name was **YUAN (袁)**, and his dream was **DISTANT (遠)**.

Everyone said his plan was **BAD (壞)**, his vision **ELEMENTARY (初)**.

He started with a **TOWEL (巾)** — simple, humble.

He stretched it into **CLOTH (布)**, then shaped it into a **HAT (帽)**.

**CURTAINS (幕)** followed, woven from **COTTON (棉)**.

Friends came **TO HELP (幫)**. The **MARKET (市)** buzzed with rumors.

Even Yuan's **LUNGS (肺)** worked overtime, breathing hope.

He fashioned a **SASH (帶)** wide enough for the horizon.

The old ways became **STAGNANT (滯)**. Yuan's innovation spread like **THORNS (刺)**.

The **SYSTEM (制)** resisted. Only licensed tailors could **MANUFACTURE (製)** for nobility.

Yuan would not be silenced. He **UTTERED (云)** a prophecy: "The sky will wear my work."

Then came **THE RAIN (雨)**.

**CLOUDS (雲)** formed from nowhere — or everywhere.

**THUNDER (雷)** announced the arrival. **ELECTRICITY (電)** crackled.

**FROST (霜)** crystallized on roof tiles. **ICE (冰)** formed on windows.

**WINTER (冬)** arrived six months early.

The **HEAVENS (天)** themselves were trying on Yuan's designs.

A child who would have **DIED YOUNG (夭)** suddenly recovered.

People began **TO PRETEND (喬)** they had supported Yuan all along.

His daughter was **ATTRACTIVE (嬌)** — suddenly popular.

Yuan built a **BRIDGE (橋)** to the clouds so all could see.

Crowds were **STANDING UP (立)** in awe.

Some **WEPT (泣)** at the **STATION (站)**, waiting for trains to the viewing platforms.

Each **CHAPTER (章)** of the journey revealed new marvels.

Nobles began **TO COMPETE (競)** for Yuan's services.

The **SOVEREIGN (帝)** himself placed an order.

Even **JUVENILE (童)** apprentices wanted to study with him.

The temple **BELL (鐘)** rang in celebration.

A traveling **SALESMAN (販)** called it **SUITABLE (適)** for gods.

The sky's old appearance became an **ENEMY (敵)** of memory.

With his **ANCIENT SPOON (匕)**, Yuan mixed dyes of impossible colors.

The **NORTH (北)** wind carried his reputation everywhere.

He turned his **BACK (背)** on the doubters.

Artists would **COMPARE (比)** all future work to his.

His **DESCENDANTS (裔)** learned **TO MIX (混)** tradition with innovation.

**ALL (皆)** would remember. **THIS (斯)** was the beginning of something new.

**SOMEWHAT (稍)** reluctantly, the Emperor admitted **IT (其)** was magnificent.

Yuan's **PURPOSE (旨)** had been fulfilled.

The sky wore **GREASE (脂)** like moisturizer.

**EVERY (每)** morning now featured new patterns.

Even the humble **SMALL PLUM (梅)** trees celebrated.

Far beyond the **SEA (海)**, news spread.

Poor artists came **TO BEG (乞)** for lessons.

Others came **TO EAT (吃)** at the celebration banquet.

Some fabrics were left **DRY (乾)**, others soaked in dew.

They would **DUPLICATE (複)** his techniques for generations.

The **ABDOMEN (腹)** of the world was full of wonder.

What had seemed **TO LACK (缺)** was now abundant.

Fans **BLEW (吹)** cooling breezes on the admiring crowds.

A **SONG (歌)** was written about Yuan's triumph.

The melody was **SOFT (軟)** as clouds.

**NEXT (次)** came the commissions from other kingdoms.

Yuan's **ASSETS (資)** grew beyond counting.

His **LOOKS (姿)** inspired paintings.

All who met him wanted **TO CONSULT WITH (諮)** the master.

*The sky had been naked since the beginning of time. Now it wore clothes.*

# LESSON 19: The Mirror of Absurdity
**Saga: Spirit** | **Characters: 29**

*Callbacks: Mirror here reflects the Sound that becomes Voice in Lesson 50*

The mirror didn't reflect faces; it reflected sounds and rhymes.

---

To find it, you had **TO COMPENSATE (賠)** — pay with something precious.

Years spent **TO CULTIVATE (培)** wisdom were the currency.

The mirror showed **SOUND (音)** as color, **DARK (暗)** tones as shapes.

Every **RHYME (韻)** appeared as a pattern on its surface.

**KNOWLEDGE (識)** itself was visible — shimmering, unstable.

A **STREAMER (幟)** of meaning flowed from every reflection.

**UNEXPECTEDLY (竟)**, the **MIRROR (鏡)** showed more than truth.

It showed **BOUNDARIES (境)** — where reality ended.

The **DECEASED (亡)** appeared in its depths, still speaking.

The **BLIND (盲)** came to see what their eyes could not.

Some visions were **ABSURD (妄)** — dreams pretending to be prophecy.

Those who **EXPECTED (望)** clarity found confusion.

**DIRECTION (方)** meant nothing here.

Some answers **HINDERED (妨)** more than helped.

Others **RELEASED (放)** the viewer from old chains.

The mirror could **EXCITE (激)** — dangerously so.

Wisdom hovered **AT (於)** the edge of madness.

**SIDE (旁)** by side, truth and lies danced.

Some viewers learned **TO CONVERT (般)** their understanding completely.

Others began **TO UNDRESS (脫)** their assumptions.

When they tried **TO SPEAK (說)** of what they saw, language failed.

**FORMERLY (曾)**, words had been enough.

Understanding began **TO INCREASE (增)**.

The grateful would **MAKE A PRESENT OF (贈)** offerings.

Pilgrims came from the **EAST (東)**.

The temple **BUILDING (棟)** could barely contain them.

In winter, the mirror would **FREEZE (凍)** — its surface solid as forgotten dreams.

*The mirror showed everything. Understanding it was the visitor's problem.*

# LESSON 20: The Snake's Egg Breakfast
**Saga: Nature** | **Characters: 38**

*Callbacks: Serpent coils into the Dragon of Lesson 54*

She went to the pond to find breakfast but found a serpent mocking her.

---

This is **ALSO (也)** a story about hunger.

**SHE (她)** woke early, stomach growling.

The **GROUND (地)** was cold beneath her feet.

She walked to the **POND (池)** where the **INSECTS (蟲)** gathered.

But waiting there was a **SERPENT (蛇)** — coiled, patient, hungry.

Beside it: an **EGG (蛋)**. One perfect sphere of potential.

**THE WIND (風)** shifted. The serpent raised its head.

It began **TO MOCK (諷)** her. "You think you can have my breakfast?"

She looked at her **SELF (己)**. What could she offer in trade?

She would have **TO ALTER (改)** her approach.

She tried **TO REMEMBER (記)** the old stories about serpents.

She had **ALREADY (已)** wasted too much time.

She picked up a leaf and began **TO WRAP (包)** the egg in her imagination.

**BUBBLES (泡)** rose from the pond — something was stirring below.

She would have **TO BEGIN (起)** again. Different strategy.

Back at her **HOUSE (家)**, she found another plan.

A new **SITE (場)** for hunting: the kitchen.

Perhaps **SOUP (湯)** would satisfy her hunger instead.

She found a **SHEEP (羊)** wandering in the yard — **BEAUTIFUL (美)**, confused.

Beyond, the **OCEAN (海)** glittered. **FRESH (鮮)** fish were possible.

But the market was too far **TO REACH (達)**.

Her **APPEARANCE (容)** was disheveled from sleep.

She had **FALLEN SHORT OF (遜)** her breakfast goals.

She would have **TO GATHER (採)** whatever she could find.

She would have **TO ADVANCE (進)** past her frustration.

What was the **STANDARD (準)** for a good breakfast anyway?

"**WHO? (誰)**" called a voice. A vendor.

He was willing **TO VEND (售)** fresh eggs.

**ALTHOUGH (雖)** they were expensive.

He seemed **RELIABLE (維)**.

By **NOON (午)**, she finally ate.

She **PERMITTED (許)** herself a moment of satisfaction.

Like **FEATHERS (羽)**, her worries floated away.

She had learned something. Tomorrow, she would **LEARN (習)** faster.

Perhaps even **SOAR (翱)** through her morning routine.

*The serpent kept its egg. She found something better: patience.*

---

# LESSON 21: The Factory of Forgetfulness
**Saga: Craft** | **Characters: 34** | **Callbacks: Heart recalls Eye from Lesson 1**

*In a factory trapped inside a solid country, workers make trousers out of hemp and regret.*

---

The worker woke up **TRAPPED (困)** inside his own dream.

Everything felt **SOLID (固)** — the walls, the air, even his thoughts.

He lived in a **COUNTRY (國)** that had forgotten how to remember.

The borders were perfectly **ROUND (圓)**, like a coin that never stops spinning.

There was **A CAUSE (因)** for this, but nobody could recall what it was.

He walked through the **PARK (園)**, where the trees grew upside down.

Every day he would **RETURN (回)** to the same bench, the same forgotten face.

His thoughts would **REVOLVE (迴)** in circles, chasing their own tails.

On the bench, someone had left a **PICTURE (圖)** — a map to nowhere.

He took it to **A STORE (店)** to have it framed.

The frame came from the **WAREHOUSE (庫)** where they kept all lost things.

He was wearing no **TROUSERS (褲)** — he'd forgotten those too.

The **FACTORY (廠)** where he worked made nothing but empty boxes.

His **BED (床)** was made of splinters and good intentions.

The sheets were woven from **HEMP (麻)**, rough against forgotten skin.

But his **HEART (心)** — his heart remembered everything. *This heart recalls the Eye that first saw creation in Lesson 1.*

He tried **TO FORGET (忘)**, but forgetting takes effort.

He learned **TO ENDURE (忍)** the weight of memories he couldn't name.

He could no longer **RECOGNIZE (認)** his own reflection.

His only **ASPIRATION (志)** was to remember what he'd lost.

The **ANNALS (誌)** of the factory recorded nothing.

He tried **TO CONSIDER (慮)** his options, but the options kept forgetting themselves.

Every **IDEA (意)** dissolved like sugar in rain.

He would **THINK (想)** — and then forget what he was thinking about.

His **BREATH (息)** came in stutters of half-remembered air.

He learned **TO FEAR (怕)** the silence between thoughts.

He could **FEEL (感)** something was missing, a shape-sized hole in his chest.

**A REGRET (憾)** — enormous and nameless — filled the space where joy should be.

He grew **WORRIED (憂)** about things he couldn't identify.

He learned **TO DREAD (懼)** the moment between sleeping and waking.

The factory kept him **BUSY (忙)** with meaningless tasks.

He became **ACCUSTOMED TO (慣)** the rhythm of forgetting.

But somewhere, deep inside, he still knew how **TO CHERISH (惜)** something.

And that, **CERTAINLY (必)**, was what kept him from disappearing entirely.

*The busy worker forgets his Trousers in the Warehouse and has to wear a Bed of Hemp.*

# LESSON 22: A Hand's Violent Day
**Saga: Body** | **Characters: 75** | **Callbacks: Hand's actions create the History that Lesson 33 will teach**

*The hand woke up and chose violence, then love, then confusion.*

---

The **HAND (手)** opened its fingers to the morning light.

It began **TO LOOK AT (看)** its own palm, reading futures it would create.

It decided **TO HOLD (握)** something — anything — to feel less empty.

"**I (我)**," said the Hand, "am the author of action."

It believed in **RIGHTEOUSNESS (義)** — or at least, it believed in believing.

It paused **TO DELIBERATE (議)** over its first move.

An **ANT (蟻)** crawled across its lifeline. The Hand considered squishing it.

Instead, it chose **TO EMBRACE (抱)** the new day.

But then it remembered violence. It wanted **TO COMBAT (戰)**.

It began **TO CRITICIZE (批)** everything it touched.

It would **BECKON (招)** strangers just to push them away.

Then it would **STRIKE (打)** — swift and sudden.

Its **FINGER (指)** pointed at the world with accusation.

It tried **TO SUPPORT (扶)** a falling leaf, but missed.

It wanted **TO INCLUDE (括)** everything in its grasp.

It struggled **TO BRING UP (捧)** water from the well.

It learned **TO BRANDISH (揮)** invisible swords at invisible enemies.

It would **PUSH (推)** doors that were meant to be pulled.

But then — a shift. It chose **TO WELCOME (迎)** a stranger.

It let its guard **HANG (掛)** loose and vulnerable.

It learned **TO PRESS DOWN ON (按)** wounds instead of causing them.

Sometimes it would **DROP (掉)** things it meant to hold.

It would **PULL (拉)** at threads of connection.

**!! (扔)** — the Hand threw everything away in frustration.

Then it began **TO LOOK FOR (找)** what it had lost.

It would **GRIND AWAY (磨)** at problems until they surrendered.

It learned **TO PLAY WITH (弄)** ideas instead of weapons.

A **NOSE (鼻)** appeared — the Hand touched it gently.

**PUNISHMENT (刑)** came for the violence it had caused.

The Hand was trapped in a **MOLD (型)** of its own making.

But the Hand was a **GENIUS (才)**, capable of change.

It discovered **RICHES (財)** in giving rather than taking.

It learned **TO DEPOSIT (存)** kindness in others.

**AT (在)** last, it understood its purpose.

**ONLY THEN (才)** did peace arrive.

It held a cup of **MILK (奶)** — gentle, nourishing.

It managed **TO CATCH UP WITH (趕)** lost time.

The Hand learned **TO INHALE (吸)** patience.

It studied **HISTORY (史)** — all the hands that came before. *These actions create the History that Lesson 33 will teach.*

It wanted to be **EVEN MORE (更)** than what it was.

It found itself **HARD (硬)** when it needed to be soft.

**AGAIN (又)** — it tried kindness.

It found a **FRIEND (友)**, another hand to hold.

They were **A PAIR (雙)** now.

Each was **ONE OF A PAIR (隻)**, incomplete alone.

Together they would **PROTECT (護)**.

Together they would **SEIZE (執)** what mattered.

They learned **TO OBSERVE (觀)** the world without grasping.

They grew **JOYOUS (歡)** in their union.

They would **THROW (投)** away resentment.

They would **NOT HAVE (沒)** regrets.

They chose **TO ESTABLISH (設)** something lasting.

A **THIGH (股)** joined them — a body taking shape.

An **OFFSHOOT (枝)** of hope emerged.

They developed **SKILL (技)**.

They became a **BRANCH (支)** of something larger.

**(PATERNAL OLDER) UNCLE (叔)** approved from the shadows.

They learned to **SUPERINTEND (督)** their impulses.

But the Hand grew **LONELY (寂)** in crowds.

It pushed **AGAINST (對)** the current of expectation.

It rested on a **PLANK (板)** over troubled water.

It decided **TO GO BACK (返)** to innocence.

It rejected **FACTION (派)** and tribalism.

It felt **BLOOD VESSELS (脈)** pulsing with new purpose.

**A CLAW (爪)** emerged — the Hand's shadow self.

It learned **TO GRAB (抓)** what it needed.

It learned **TO PLUCK (採)** fruit without damaging the tree.

It learned **TO PICK (挑)** its battles.

It gathered **VEGETABLE (菜)** for a humble meal.

It chose **TO ACCEPT (受)** what it could not change.

It would **CONFER (授)** wisdom on younger hands.

And finally, it discovered **LOVE (愛)** — vast and terrifying.

The feeling was **GRAND (博)**.

It built a **PLATFORM (臺)** for others to stand upon.

It learned **TO GOVERN (治)** itself.

And with that, it was ready **TO COMMENCE (始)** again.

The Hand decided **TO GO (去)** forward.

It found a **METHOD (法)** for living.

It would continue **UNTIL (至)** its work was done.

It entered a **ROOM (室)** filled with light.

It had **ARRIVED (到)**.

It achieved **MUTUAL (互)** understanding with the world.

It had become **SUFFICIENT (夠)** unto itself.

It embraced **EDUCATION (育)** — teaching others to open their fists.

It let kindness **FLOW (流)** through every finger.

And with a **COMB (梳)**, it straightened the tangles of the day.

*The Hand grabs a Vegetable and combs it with a Claw until it flows with Milk.*

# LESSON 23: The Secret Valley of Bathing
**Saga: Nature** | **Characters: 16** | **Callbacks: Valley recalls stone from Lesson 7**

*Deep in the mountain, there is a secret valley where bears go to bathe.*

---

The **MOUNTAIN (山)** had kept this secret for ten thousand years.

Few dared **TO EXIT (出)** the safety of the lowlands.

Those who climbed had **TO BEAT (擊)** their fear into submission.

The path was **SECRET (密)**, known only to the desperate and the curious.

One had **TO ENTER (入)** through a crack in the world.

The way was **INTERNAL (內)**, a journey of the self.

The first travelers would **HOLLER (嚷)** into the void, hoping for echoes.

This was only one **PART (部)** of the journey.

Most who came were **IMPOVERISHED (貧)** — in coin, in spirit, in hope.

The valley was **PUBLIC (公)** to none but the mountains themselves.

A great **PINE TREE (松)** marked the entrance.

Beyond it lay the **VALLEY (谷)** — still and sacred. *It recalls the stone that first named itself in Lesson 7.*

Here, one could **BATHE (浴)** in waters older than memory.

Here, one could admit **DESIRE (欲)** without shame.

Here, **THE LUST (慾)** for life itself was cleansed and renewed.

The valley **CONTAINED (含)** all things, and it taught visitors **TO DISSOLVE (溶)** their burdens.

*The Pine Tree, impoverished and desperate for a bath, dissolves completely into the Valley, leaving only its Desire behind.*

# LESSON 24: The Old Woman's Political Party
**Saga: Empire** | **Characters: 66** | **Callbacks: Ear recalls Eye from Lesson 1; Husband becomes Father in Lesson 33**

*An Old Woman started a political party based on quilts and malicious gossip.*

---

She had learned **TO WORK AS (當)** many things in her life.

She kept **FILES (檔)** on everyone who had ever wronged her.

Her **POLITICAL PARTY (黨)** met every Thursday.

**OFTEN (常)**, they discussed revenge.

The **MAIN ROOM (堂)** was draped in suspicion.

Every secret needed a **COVERING (罩)**.

Their emotions came in **WAVES (浪)**.

The **OLD WOMAN (婆)** sat at the head, knitting grudges.

She had learned **TO BREAK (破)** things that needed breaking.

She kept everyone wrapped in **A QUILT (被)** of obligation.

Her words were **MALICIOUS (惡)**, but her pastries were excellent.

Members would **LINE UP (排)** for both.

The debates were **INTENSE (烈)**.

**DEATH (死)** was a frequent topic of conversation.

They discussed proper ways **TO INTER (葬)** enemies.

The Old Woman's **EAR (耳)** heard everything. *It recalls the Eye that first witnessed creation in Lesson 1.*

She would **TAKE (取)** what she needed.

She had **AN INTEREST (趣)** in power.

She was **MOST (最)** determined of them all.

This was her **JOB (職)**.

She considered it **HOLY (聖)**.

One had to be **BRAVE (勇)** to oppose her.

Her rules were **STRICT (嚴)**.

Her speeches were **DRAWN OUT (長)**, and deliberately **SLOW (慢)**.

But sometimes her anger would **OVERFLOW (漫)**.

She wore **A RING (環)** that had belonged to every chairman before her.

She would never **GIVE BACK (還)** what she had taken.

Her **HUSBAND (夫)** had learned this early. *He becomes Father in Lesson 33.*

The **REGULATIONS (規)** were simple: obey or be quilted.

She would **REPLACE (換)** anyone who failed.

Many had learned **TO LOSE (失)** gracefully.

The **FEUDAL OFFICIAL (臣)** in her ancestry smiled down from portraits.

She was always **ABOUT TO (將)** make an announcement.

She promoted only the **WORTHY (賢)**.

Her decisions were **FIRM (堅)**.

**POWER (權)** flowed through her like electricity.

There was always **ANOTHER (別)** scheme in motion.

When challenged, she would simply **TURN (轉)** the tables.

The **MALE (男)** members had no special privilege.

**ACHIEVEMENT (功)** was measured in loyalty alone.

Some whispered she was a **SLAVE (奴)** driver.

Others knew she **TOILED (勞)** harder than anyone.

She would **ADD (加)** to her collection of secrets daily.

Members would **CONGRATULATE (賀)** her victories with tea.

Awards lined the **SHELF (架)**.

Everyone had to **COOPERATE (協)**.

This was the **LINE OF BUSINESS (業)** she had chosen.

The **LAW (法)** was whatever she said it was.

Eventually, all would **RECOVER (復)** from her rule — or not.

One **MUST (須)** adapt to survive.

She knew how **TO TREAT (待)** each member individually.

The party moved **TOWARD (往)** total neighborhood dominance.

She preached **MORALITY (德)** with a wink.

All had **TO LISTEN (聽)**.

The **HALL (廳)** echoed with her pronouncements.

Even **TINY (微)** infractions were punished.

Every **STREET (街)** knew her name.

**DON'T (別)** cross her, they said.

*The Feudal Official loses his Ear in a Quilt and enacts a Law against sleeping.*

# LESSON 25: The Committee of Rice and Riddles
**Saga: Craft** | **Characters: 28** | **Callbacks: Bamboo recalls Forest from Lesson 10; Rice feeds the Meal of Lesson 37**

*The committee met in the autumn to discuss the serious business of perfume and riddles.*

---

The **STANDING GRAIN (禾)** swayed in the autumn wind, waiting for judgment.

The delegates had made a long **JOURNEY (程)** to be here.

They came seeking **HARMONY (和)** — or at least, a reasonable facsimile.

The agenda would **SHIFT (移)** hourly.

It was **AUTUMN (秋)**, the season of serious discussions.

The mood was **GLOOMY (愁)**, as all committee moods tend to be.

They debated **A PROFIT (利)** margin on hope itself.

Someone had brought **PERFUME (香)** — its scent dominated the room.

They divided discussions by **SEASONS (季)**.

The **COMMITTEE (委)** had met for a hundred years, solving nothing.

Their methods were **ELEGANT (雅)**, if ineffective.

They tried **TO PENETRATE (透)** the mysteries of breakfast.

They would **ENTICE (誘)** each other with promises of solutions.

**EXPERIENCE (歷)** had taught them patience.

**RICE (米)** was the true subject of all debates. *This Rice will feed the Meal of Lesson 37.*

Many delegates were **LOST (迷)** in procedural tangles.

The only escape was to solve a **RIDDLE (謎)**.

They debated **THE KIND (類)** of answer that would satisfy.

**BAMBOO (竹)** scrolls recorded every word. *This Bamboo recalls the Forest where stories were first written in Lesson 10.*

Sometimes, the only response was **TO LAUGH (笑)**.

Documents were stored in a **BOX (箱)** that no one could open.

Each delegate carried a **PEN (筆)** that wrote in riddles.

And so on, **ETC. (等)** — the agenda continued forever.

They tried **TO CALCULATE (算)** the incalculable.

No one knew how **TO ANSWER (答)** the fundamental questions.

In the end, they settled on **STRATEGY (策)**: meet again next autumn.

*The Committee gets lost in a Box of Bamboo Rice and has to answer a Riddle to get out.*

# LESSON 26: The Prisoner's Furniture Store
**Saga: Family** | **Characters: 69** | **Callbacks: Prisoner escapes to become the Criminal of Lesson 36**

*A prisoner escaped and opened a furniture store, but he only sold chairs to himself.*

---

He was just one **PERSON (人)** among millions.

He had been a **PRISONER (囚)**, counting days on cell walls.

His **PORTION (份)** of life had seemed small.

He used **TO OCCUPY (佔)** a space no bigger than a dream.

Now he sold **FURNITURE (傢俱)** — mostly to ghosts.

"Can I help **YOU (你)**?" he'd ask the empty store.

"How may I help **YOU [RESPECTFUL] (您)**?" he'd bow to no one.

**WHAT? (何)** — he'd ask himself daily.

He arranged chairs in **A STRIP (條)** along the wall.

He understood **VALUE (值)** differently now.

He'd learned how **TO MAKE (做)** things from nothing.

**HOWEVER (但)**, customers rarely came.

He chose **TO DWELL (住)** among his creations.

He held a **POSITION (位)** of dignity in his own mind.

Each chair was a **PIECE (件)** of his freedom.

He would **STILL (仍)** wait for buyers.

**HE (他)** believed they would come.

Sometimes he needed **TO REST (休)**.

He had **FAITH (信)** in the universe's furniture needs.

He learned **TO DEPEND ON (倚)** himself.

He became an **EXAMPLE (例)** of patient commerce.

Each customer was an **INDIVIDUAL (個)** miracle.

He stayed **HEALTHY (健)**.

Sometimes he would **HALT (停)** to appreciate silence.

Once he hung a chair **UPSIDE DOWN (倒)** — it sold immediately.

He practiced **BENEVOLENCE (仁)** toward browsers.

His craftsmanship was **EXCELLENT (優)**.

He would bandage **A WOUND (傷)** with sawdust and kindness.

He learned **TO SAFEGUARD (保)** his inventory.

His store became a **FORT (堡)** against loneliness.

He would **PAY (付)** his bills on time.

The **GOVERNMENT OFFICE (府)** left him alone.

He would **SUBSTITUTE FOR (代)** happiness with purpose.

He kept his lunch in a **BAG (袋)**.

Freedom had begun **TO TRANSFORM (化)** him.

He sold a **FLOWER (花)**-patterned ottoman once.

His **COMMODITIES (貨)** gathered dust with dignity.

**WHATWHICHWHOWHEREWHY? (哪)** — the questions faded.

Life was **CONVENIENT (便)** enough.

His store was **100 CHINESE INCHES (丈)** of paradise.

He had learned **TO USE (用)** what he had.

For a **LONG TIME (久)**, he was content.

He measured success by the **CHINESE ACRE (畝)**.

Today was the **THIRD (丙)** anniversary of his escape.

He gripped **A HANDLE (柄)** — a new chair back, smooth and ready.

He could afford **MEAT (肉)** now, when he wanted it.

Some of his early work was **ROTTEN (腐)** — he'd learned.

He served the **MULTITUDE (眾)** — even if the multitude was imaginary.

He loved **TO SIT (坐)** in chairs he'd never sell.

He'd found his **SEAT (座)** in the world.

He would **EXAMINE (察)** each joint for weakness.

**A FACE (面)** appeared at the window — a real customer!

They had **COME (來)**!

They asked about a **WHEAT (麥)**-colored armchair.

Did he have anything **TO DRINK (飲)**?

They were **THIRSTY (渴)**.

He would **BOW HIS HEAD (俯)** in gratitude.

*The Prisoner eats rotten Meat from a Bag while sitting upside down on his Furniture.*

# LESSON 27: The Court of Night Liquids
**Saga: Empire** | **Characters: 18** | **Callbacks: Night recalls Month from Lesson 1; Night Liquid becomes the Liquor of Lesson 37**

*In the Royal Court, they don't drink wine; they drink the liquid of the night.*

---

The position was difficult **TO APPOINT (任)**.

Everyone wanted a seat in the **ROYAL COURT (廷)**.

The **COURT OF LAW (庭)** handled disputes over darkness.

**BY MEANS OF (以)** ancient tradition, all light was forbidden.

The courtiers were **SIMILAR (似)** in their hunger for shadow.

Factions would **COMBINE (併)** against the dawn.

They would **PIECE TOGETHER (拼)** alliances in whispers.

The throne was a **SPINE (脊)** of obsidian.

Each **ASSOCIATE (夥)** wore robes of midnight.

**GLORY (榮)** was measured in absence of light.

**LABOR (勞)** meant carrying darkness from room to room.

**A CAMP (營)** of loyalists guarded the queen's shadow.

Only the **VIRTUOUS (賢)** could serve.

Each **YEAR (年)** brought new rituals of obscurity.

The **NIGHT (夜)** was their god. *It recalls the Month that first measured time in Lesson 1.*

They drank only **LIQUID (液)** extracted from darkness itself. *This becomes the Liquor of Lesson 37.*

They would **CALL OUT (喚)** to each other across black halls.

Secrets were the only currency worth **EXCHANGING (換)**.

*The Associate tries to piece together his Spine using Night Liquid.*

# LESSON 28: The Corpse's Vacation
