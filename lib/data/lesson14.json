  "title": "The Soldier's Dream of Capital",
  "theme": "A superfluous army marches toward the capital, carrying dreams of glory. Through pits and mountains they learn to enjoy the journey itself, until the capital appears — cool, scenic, exactly as the old songs described. The dream was the journey; the capital was just where it ended.",
  "memory_palace": "The Road to the Capital",
  "narrative_arc": "Superfluous army → Profound thoughts → Army moves → Radiance catches → Carrying dreams → Crown imagined → Dream sustained → Pits crossed → Tall mountains → Enjoyment learned → Boots ripe → Pavilion rest → Shining faces → Capital appears → Cool descent → Scenery perfect → At once together → Circumference walked → Week to circle → Soldiers counted → Lucky chosen → Buying supplies → Selling begins",
  "narrative_story": "They were superfluous — an army that no war required. Their thoughts were profound — sinking deeper than their footsteps. The army moved as one, their armor catching radiance. Each soldier had something to carry — a dream, a promise, a reason. They imagined the crown that awaited their general. This was their dream — to witness triumph. They crossed pits and valleys without complaint. The tall mountains did not stop them. They learned to enjoy the journey itself. Their boots became ripe with dust and memory. At each pavilion they rested, their faces shining. Finally: the capital appeared on the horizon. The air grew cool as they descended into the valley. The scenery was exactly as the old songs described. They would arrive at once — together, as brothers. The circumference of the city walls took a week to walk. Every soldier was counted. Every name recorded. The lucky ones would be presented to the Emperor. They could finally buy supplies — real food, clean clothes. Street vendors rushed to sell them everything. The dream was the journey. The capital was just where it ended.",
