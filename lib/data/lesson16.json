  "theme": "A burglar with a theatrical style attempts to steal an entire city made of iron",

  "narrative_arc": "Style established → Test of physics → Halberd brandished → Choice made → Burglar revealed → Gates laden → Iron surfaces → Lush gardens → City transforms → City lives → Sincerity in madness → Guards of might → Destruction fails → Everyone knows → Reduced to nothing → List made → War declared → Coins spent → Shallow motives → Cheap victory",
  "narrative_story": "A burglar with a style all his own decided to steal an entire city made of iron. His style was unmistakable — theatrical, absurd, impossible. Every heist was a test of physics. He carried a halberd — impractical, but impressive. 'Steal gold or steal glory,' he said. 'I choose both.' The burglar had one target: the Iron City. Its gates were laden with ore from a thousand mines. Every surface was iron — walls, floors, fountains. The gardens were lush with metal flowers. The city had begun to turn into something beyond architecture. The city was alive, in its iron way. Its builders were sincere in their madness. Guards of great might patrolled constantly. Many had tried to destroy the Iron City. All had failed. Everyone knew its defenses were perfect. To even attempt theft would reduce a man to nothing. The burglar made a list of everything he wanted. This would not be theft. This would be war. But wars cost coins, and his motives were shallow. In the end, he stole one thing: a cheap iron nail. Sometimes the greatest heists are the smallest ones.",
