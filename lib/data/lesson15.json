  "theme": "Officer Chen's terrible poetry is the most feared weapon in the precinct — criminals surrender rather than endure his verses",
  "memory_palace": "The Police Precinct",
  "narrative_arc": "Book kept → Drawings made → Verses scratched → Attack avoided → Failed beautifully → Deliberately bad → Rescue attempted → Revered by criminals → Spacious office → Words spoken → Police purpose → Plan created → Prison record → Condemn to end → Instructions given → Talk begins → Poems weaponized → Language illegal → Read and surrender → Tune maximized → Discuss crimes → This ends",
  "narrative_story": "The most dangerous weapon in the precinct wasn't the gun — it was Officer Chen's poetry book. His other officers made drawings of crime scenes; he wrote sonnets. When bored, he would scratch verses onto his desk. Most cops attack problems directly — not Chen. He had learned to fail beautifully. Deliberately bad poetry was his specialty. He once tried to rescue a hostage with a haiku. Criminals had learned to revere his terrible verses. His office was spacious — nobody wanted to share it. When he began to say anything, people fled. The police department kept him for one reason only: he could create a plan that no criminal would expect. His record of prison sentences was perfect. Judges would condemn criminals just to end his recitals. His instructions were legendary: 'First, we read them poetry. Then the talk begins.' His poems were weapons of mass confusion. His language was technically Mandarin but emotionally illegal. Criminals would read his verses and surrender immediately. He could tune his voice to maximum cringe. 'Let us discuss your crimes,' he'd say. 'This will not take long.'",
