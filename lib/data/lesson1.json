  "narrative_story": "In primordial darkness, a single stroke appeared—ONE. Loneliness drove it to duplicate, becoming TWO parallel lines. A third joined them, stacking like ascending steps: THREE. Four boundaries enclosed space for the first time—FOUR, the initial container. Five strokes converged at a crossing: FIVE, a meeting point. Reality folded as SIX completed an enclosure. Children drew light with a skyward slash: SEVEN. Wings spread wide in separation: EIGHT. A questioning curve bent like a hook: NINE. A cross marked the destination: TEN—the universe had counted itself into being. Yet who performed this counting? A perfect square opened: the MOUTH that spoke numbers. This mouth observed the DAY, a blazing window to the sun. Beside it gleamed the MONTH, a crescent measuring cycles. Below stretched the RICE FIELD, sustaining existence. Reflected in its waters gazed the EYE, witnessing everything. The cosmos awakened through observation.",
