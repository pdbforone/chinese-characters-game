  "narrative_story": "The serpent guarded the egg beside the pond, and all the creatures of field and sky came to watch. 'Also here,' said the insects, announcing their presence. She arrived at dawn — woman or spirit, no one knew. The ground beneath the pond was sacred. The pond was the center of everything. Insects buzzed their anticipation. The serpent coiled tighter. The egg must be protected at all costs. The wind blew cold warnings. Some came to mock the scene, calling it superstition. The serpent possessed a strange self-awareness. Plans were altered hourly. Memory awakened in the oldest watchers. Already the ritual had begun. Everything was wrapped in mystery. Bubbles rose from the pond's depths. The beginning was uncertain — had it ever not been happening? A house stood nearby, abandoned. The site was contested — who owned sacred ground? Soup was served to the pilgrims. Sheep gathered at the edges, curious. It was a beautiful morning for a mystery. The ocean lay distant but somehow present. Everything felt fresh, renewed. Some traveled far, reaching the shore with difficulty. Every appearance was studied for omens. Most found themselves falling short of understanding. The gathering was complete by midday. All were advancing forward in their understanding. Standards were set for proper worship. 'Who decides?' asked the skeptics. Vending at the site eventually ended. Although uncertain, the crowd stayed. Only a reliable witness could confirm what happened. Noon arrived with no resolution. Permission was granted to approach. Feathers fell from the sky. Learning would continue long after. Those who understood found themselves soaring above ordinary existence. The egg never hatched. The serpent never moved. The mystery remained. And that was the breakfast — unanswered questions served cold.",
