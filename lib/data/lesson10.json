  "theme": "An absurdist tale of a forest full of stupid apricot trees, a student who died laughing, and his younger sister's investigation into the mystery",
  "memory_palace": "The Stupid Forest",
  "narrative_arc": "Tree stands alone → Woods form → Forest grows → Planting fails → Apricots spread → Dim-wittedness reigns → Trees wither → Village huddles → Mutual dependence → Student documents → Legal case opens → Verdict pending → Last owner dies → Foam marks grave → Flavor baffles → Sister arrives → Investigation begins → Sediment sifted → Dye attempts → Plums slightly smarter → Table set → As if return expected → Grass invades → Suffering recorded → Forest widens → Leaves question → Nobody understands → Imitation attempted → Desert emerges → Grave found → Seedling grows → Attention aimed",
  "narrative_story": "Not all forests are wise; this one is full of dim-witted apricot trees. First, there was a tree — singular, vertical, reaching for light. Then woods — two trees became companions. Then the forest — three trees became a world. Someone had thought to plant order here. They failed. Apricot trees grew everywhere — sweet, fragrant, absolutely stupid. They were dim-witted — mouths open, vacant stares. Many had already withered — too foolish to find water. A village huddled at the forest's edge. The villagers traded with the trees. They depended on one another — humans and apricots, mutual incompetence. A student came with a notebook — determined to document this oddity. It became a legal case — who owned these ridiculous trees? The answer: not yet determined. The last owner had died laughing at an apricot's joke. His grave was marked with foam — the trees' attempt at flowers. The flavor of the fruit was indescribable — sweet and baffling. The old man's younger sister came to investigate. She sifted through the sediment of his life. The trees had tried to dye his burial clothes. They used plum juice. The plum trees were only slightly smarter. She found his table still set for dinner. As if he had expected to return. Grass grew through the floorboards. His notes spoke of suffering — the taste of wisdom in a stupid world. The forest was wide — endless, in its dim-witted way. Each leaf held a question no one thought to ask. Nobody understood the trees. Nobody tried. The sister tried to imitate her brother's research. She wandered until the forest became desert — trees giving way to sand. She found a grave she didn't recognize. Beside it grew a seedling — small, determined, possibly less stupid than its parents. She bent down to aim her attention at this tiny hope. Maybe the next generation would learn. Maybe the forest would wake up.",
