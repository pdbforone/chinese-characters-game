  "narrative_story": "Someone had to dress the sky, and only one tailor was foolish enough to try. It began with clothing — a single garment, stitched with impossible ambition. Inside the tailor's workshop, grief hung like dust. His name was Yuan, and his dream was distant. Everyone said his plan was bad, his vision elementary. He started with a towel — simple, humble. He stretched it into cloth, then shaped it into a hat. Curtains followed, woven from cotton. Friends came to help. The market buzzed with rumors. Even Yuan's lungs worked overtime, breathing hope. He fashioned a sash wide enough for the horizon. The old ways became stagnant. Yuan's innovation spread like thorns. The system resisted. Only licensed tailors could manufacture for nobility. Yuan would not be silenced. He uttered a prophecy: 'The sky will wear my work.' Then came the rain. Clouds formed from nowhere — or everywhere. Thunder announced the arrival. Electricity crackled. Frost crystallized on roof tiles. Ice formed on windows. Winter arrived six months early. The heavens themselves were trying on Yuan's designs. A child who would have died young suddenly recovered. People began to pretend they had supported Yuan all along. His daughter was attractive — suddenly popular. Yuan built a bridge to the clouds so all could see. Crowds were standing up in awe. Some wept at the station, waiting for trains to the viewing platforms. Each chapter of the journey revealed new marvels. Nobles began to compete for Yuan's services. The sovereign himself placed an order. Even juvenile apprentices wanted to study with him. The temple bell rang in celebration. A traveling salesman called it suitable for gods. The sky's old appearance became an enemy of memory. With his ancient spoon, Yuan mixed dyes of impossible colors. The north wind carried his reputation everywhere. He turned his back on the doubters. Artists would compare all future work to his. His descendants learned to mix tradition with innovation. All would remember. This was the beginning of something new. Somewhat reluctantly, the Emperor admitted it was magnificent. Yuan's purpose had been fulfilled. The sky wore grease like moisturizer. Every morning now featured new patterns. Even the humble small plum trees celebrated. Far beyond the sea, news spread. Poor artists came to beg for lessons. Others came to eat at the celebration banquet. Some fabrics were left dry, others soaked in dew. They would duplicate his techniques for generations. The abdomen of the world was full of wonder. What had seemed to lack was now abundant. Fans blew cooling breezes on the admiring crowds. A song was written about Yuan's triumph. The melody was soft as clouds. Next came the commissions from other kingdoms. Yuan's assets grew beyond counting. His looks inspired paintings. All who met him wanted to consult with the master. The sky had been naked since the beginning of time. Now it wore clothes.",
