  "theme": "Politics as an endless series of footsteps leading nowhere correct",
  "memory_palace": "The Political Labyrinth",
  "narrative_arc": "Stop first → Footstep forward → Ford the river → Repeatedly compromise → Agree or die → Looking forward to failure → Years pile up → Military waits → Levy contested → Correct path hidden → Politics played → Settle on something → Walk through minefields → Transcend the game → Surpass expectations → Question of being → Topic as trap → Build empires → Prolong reign → Nativity of ideas → Clarity survives → Foundation endures",
  "narrative_story": "Politics is just a series of footsteps that lead nowhere correct. First, you must stop. Then take a footstep forward. Then you must ford a river of paperwork. Repeatedly you will be asked to compromise. You must agree or be destroyed. Everyone is looking forward to your failure. The years of age pile up like fallen leaves. The military waits in the wings. Every levy is contested. Every tax questioned. The correct path is never the obvious one. Politics is a game with no winners. You must settle on something eventually. You learn to walk through minefields. Those who transcend the game rarely survive it. Those who surpass expectations are feared. The question is not who you are but what you are. Every topic is a trap. Those who build empires watch them crumble. Those who prolong their reign invite assassination. The nativity of new ideas is always bloody. Only clarity of purpose survives. Only a solid foundation endures. Politics is walking in circles. But some circles are larger than others.",
