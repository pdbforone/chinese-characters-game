  "narrative_arc": "Introduction made → World bounded → Tea served → Meeting called → Game fits perfectly → Ha! laughed → Pagoda revealed → King produces → Jade spheres → Balls presented → Present to court → Playing begins → Crazy consumed → Emperor investigates → Resplendent robes → Scores submitted → Whole court mad → Logic fled → Lord resists → Pouring attention refused → Gold offered → Copper tried → Fishing attempted → Needle threatened → Nail hammered → Inscription carved → At ease finally",
  "narrative_story": "The King wanted to introduce something new to his world. Over tea, he announced a meeting of all nobles. 'I have created a game,' he said. 'It will fit our greatness.' 'Ha!' laughed the court. They assumed he was joking. From the tallest pagoda, the King produced two jade spheres. 'Behold — the balls!' He presented them to the court. The nobles began to play. Within hours, everyone had gone crazy. The Emperor arrived to investigate. His robes were resplendent. All nobles were required to submit their scores. The whole court was consumed. Even logic had fled. Only the Lord of the Eastern Province remained sane. He refused to pour his attention into the game. The King tried bribery. He offered gold. Then copper — cheaper, but still shiny. He even tried to go fishing for the Lord's interest. Nothing worked. Finally, the King threatened him with a needle — torture by acupuncture. Still nothing. The King hammered a nail through the game board in frustration. On it, he carved an inscription: 'This game will destroy us all.' Then he sat back, suddenly at ease. Some games are meant to be lost.",
