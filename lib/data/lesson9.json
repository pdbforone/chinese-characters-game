  "narrative_arc": "Journey measured → Quantity calculated → Entrance buried → Blackness engulfs → Spots emerge → Ink consumed → Risk taken → Seekers united → Cave depths reached → Orientation lost → Character esteemed → Texts guarded → Copying finished → Reality found → Completion proclaimed → Nighttime work → Peace in darkness → Banquet celebrated → Invitations mailed → Wealthy attend → Wisdom stored",
  "narrative_story": "In a cave buried a thousand Li away, they hold a banquet where you eat only ink. The journey measured a li — then another, then a thousand. The quantity of distance was meaningless; only commitment mattered. They would bury the entrance after you entered. No going back. Inside, everything was black — the color of secrets, the color of ink. Your eyes adjusted to find spots of lesser darkness. Black ink was the only substance allowed. You drank it. You breathed it. To attend was to risk everything: eyesight, sanity, the surface world. Yet they all came. They were the same — seekers of the hidden word. The cave went deeper than geography. Orientation was a memory. Which way was up? Here, scholars gathered to esteem one thing only: the written character. They guarded texts too dangerous for sunlight. Their task: to finish copying the forbidden manuscripts. This was reality — more real than the kingdoms above. Heralds would proclaim when a new text was complete. All work happened at nighttime — in a cave, there was no day. Despite the darkness, they were peaceful. The ink calmed them. The great banquet came once per year. Invitations were sent by mail — black envelopes, black ink, black wax. Only the wealthy could afford the journey. Those who returned learned to store up what they had learned — hidden, protected, waiting. In a cave buried a thousand Li away, knowledge eats itself and grows stronger.",
