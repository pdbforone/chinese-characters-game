  "title": "The Dog Who Cried Peach",
  "theme": "A remarkable dog discovers a portent: the sky is raining peaches. While villagers scramble and the oracle cow declares vast changes, only the dog remembers what came before.",
  "memory_palace": "The Peach Rain Village",
  "narrative_arc": "Portent appears → Peaches fall → Pooch sees first → Remarkable observation → Silence held → Sort of thing unprecedented → Crying begins → Utensils grabbed → Stinking dog avoided → Other dogs flee → Villagers detest → Pressure mounts → Cow steps forward → Special oracle speaks → Declaration made → Vast change proclaimed → Before remembered → Washing prepares",
  "narrative_story": "It began with a portent — cracks in the sky, whispers in the wind. Then came the peaches — falling like sweet, fuzzy rain. The pooch saw it first. He was remarkable — sharper than other dogs. He sat in silence for a long time, watching the fruit fall. This was a sort of thing that had never happened before. Then he began to cry — not from sadness, but from the weight of knowing. The villagers grabbed every utensil they could find to catch the peaches. But the dog was stinking — he'd rolled in something foul that morning. The other dogs avoided him. Even the peaches seemed to fall elsewhere. The villagers grew to detest him. His smell. His crying. His knowing. Pressure mounted. Someone had to explain this miracle. The cow stepped forward. She was special — the village oracle. She began to declare: 'This is a sign! A vast change is coming!' Everyone listened. Everyone except the dog. He remembered what came before — the last time peaches fell. So he went to wash himself in the river, preparing for what was next. The cow could declare. The dog would prepare.",
