  "narrative_story": "The King introduced a new game to the world involving jade, tea, and insanity. Over tea, he announced a meeting of all nobles and produced two jade spheres from the tallest pagoda. Within hours, everyone had gone crazy. The Emperor arrived to investigate, and the whole court was consumed—even logic had fled. Only the Lord of the Eastern Province remained sane. The King tried bribery with gold, copper, and finally torture by needle. In frustration, he hammered a nail through the game board and carved an inscription: 'This game will destroy us all.'",
