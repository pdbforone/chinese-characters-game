  "narrative_story": "Fashion Week began with clothing spread across every surface. Inside the tents, designers prepared their grief-stricken collections—mourning clothes for the Yuan dynasty's distant memory. The reviews were bad. At the elementary level, models clutched towels and arranged cloth. One wore a dramatic hat. Another adjusted curtains made of cotton. Assistants rushed to help at the market booth selling accessories for the lungs—breathing masks wrapped with sashes. The air grew stagnant. A thorn pricked one model's finger. The system broke down. They had to manufacture replacements quickly. Then someone uttered: 'Look at the sky.' The rain began. Clouds gathered. Thunder rolled across the heavens. Electricity crackled. Frost formed on the windows. Ice covered the runway. Winter had arrived during summer. The heavens themselves seemed to die young. Models pretended to cross the bridge while looking attractive. Those still standing began to weep at the station. A new chapter began as designers competed. The sovereign watched with juvenile amusement as bells rang. A salesman declared the show suitable for enemies. With ancient spoons they ate from the north, backs turned to compare descendants. Everything mixed together—all of this somewhat blurred. It had lost its purpose. Grease stained every fabric. Every small plum tree by the sea seemed to beg: eat me while I'm still dry. They tried to duplicate the original designs. Models clutched their abdomens, lacking strength. They blew their last song into the soft wind. Next time, they'd protect their assets. Their looks would need consultation.",
