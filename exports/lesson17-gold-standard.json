  "narrative_story": "The old philosopher knew when to stop. His footsteps had carried him far—across rivers he had to ford, through villages he visited repeatedly. Not everyone would agree with his teachings. But he looked forward to finding students who would understand. At seventy years of age, he reflected on his journey. In his youth, the military had called him. He had paid the levy to avoid conscription. Now his only battle was teaching what was correct. Politics disgusted him—too many compromises. He had settled on a simple life. He preferred to walk alone at dawn. His thoughts would transcend ordinary concerns. His wisdom had surpassed that of younger scholars. This was his true nature—to be a teacher. The topic of his final lecture consumed him. He would build something lasting. His words would prolong his legacy. This nativity of ideas was his true birth. His teachings were clear as mountain water. They would become the foundation for generations to come.",
