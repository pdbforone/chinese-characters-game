  "narrative_story": "The mountain stood eternal. From its peaks, monks would exit daily, walking down to beat the temple drums. They kept their practices secret. Some would enter the hidden paths to find internal peace. Others would holler their prayers to the sky. The teachings were divided into parts—some for the impoverished, others public knowledge. Pine trees lined the path to the valley below. There, disciples would bathe in cold streams. They sought to conquer desire, especially the lust that plagued young monks. The valley could contain multitudes. In time, all attachments would dissolve like morning mist.",
