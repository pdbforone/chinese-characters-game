  "narrative_story": "Every person in the village was counted. The prisoner sat trapped in the square. Each portion was carefully occupied. Furniture filled the homes. You were recorded, and you respectfully answered what? Each strip had value. They made things, however we dwelled in assigned positions. Each piece was still accounted for. He rested by the tree. Faith depended on examples. Each individual was healthy until they halted, turned upside down. Benevolence was excellent but wounds needed safeguarding. The fort demanded payment to the government office, heads bowed. To substitute for the lost, a bag was transformed. Flowers became commodities. What was convenient? A hundred inches were used over a long time. Chinese acres measured third-ranked handles. Meat turned rotten. The multitude sat in their seats. We examined each face as they came. Wheat was drunk when thirsty.",
