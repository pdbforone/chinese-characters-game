  "narrative_story": "The siege began with a test of style—who could wield the halberd with the most deadly flair? 'Or we could simply wait them out,' someone suggested. But the burglars who had infiltrated the enemy camp disagreed. Their war carts arrived laden with iron weapons. The lush fields outside the city walls would soon turn into graveyards. The city itself stood defiant. Its citizens remained sincere in their belief they would survive. The might of the attacking army was legendary—ten thousand strong. They had come to destroy everything within the walls. Everybody knew what was coming. The defenders worked to reduce their numbers through night raids. The general studied his list of tactical targets. War had truly begun, and there would be no turning back. Coins scattered across the muddy ground—payment for mercenaries who fought for neither side. The city moat had grown shallow in the summer drought. Human life had become cheap. The only question was: who would still be standing when the iron stopped singing?",
