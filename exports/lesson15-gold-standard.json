  "narrative_story": "The most dangerous weapon in the precinct wasn't the gun—it was Officer Chen's poetry book. He kept a book in his pocket at all times. His other officers made drawings of crime scenes. He wrote sonnets. When bored, he would scratch verses onto his desk. Most cops attack problems directly. Not Chen. He had learned to fail beautifully. Deliberately bad poetry was his specialty. He once tried to rescue a hostage with a haiku. Criminals had learned to revere his terrible verses. His office was spacious—nobody wanted to share it. When he began to say anything, people fled. The police department kept him for one reason only. He could create a plan that no criminal would expect. His record of prison sentences was perfect. Judges would condemn criminals just to end his recitals. His instructions were legendary. 'First, we read them poetry.' 'Then, the talk begins.' His poems were weapons of mass confusion. His language was technically Mandarin but emotionally illegal. Criminals would read his verses and surrender immediately. He could tune his voice to maximum cringe. 'Let us discuss your crimes,' he'd say, opening his book. 'This will not take long.' No criminal ever returned to his precinct. The poetry was that bad.",
