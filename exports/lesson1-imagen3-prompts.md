## Testing Workflow

1. **Generate all 15 images** using the prompts above
2. **Save with naming convention:** `lesson1_01_yi_one.png`, `lesson1_02_er_two.png`, etc.
3. **Evaluate for:**
   - Style consistency across all 15
   - Clarity and legibility at small sizes (resize to 512x512)
   - Emotional tone matching the mnemonic
   - Cultural authenticity (does it feel "Chinese" without being stereotypical?)

4. **Document issues:** Which prompts need refinement? What's working?

## Next Steps After Testing

If results are good:

- Expand to Lessons 2-5 (more characters)
- Consider Flux.2 for production (better consistency)
- Begin stroke order data sourcing

If results need work:

- Refine style prefix
- Adjust individual prompts
- Try different aspect ratios
