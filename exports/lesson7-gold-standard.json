    "narrative_story": "A small stone decided it wanted to be a large sun. It was SMALL — insignificant, overlooked, stepped upon. It had FEW admirers and even fewer friends. When it tried to speak, its voice was NOISY — grating, irritating. The sun, by contrast, was LARGE — vast, warm, the center of everything. The stone sharpened itself to a TIP — small on top, large on bottom. Ready to pierce. Each EVENING, it watched the sun descend and dreamed of rising. There were MANY evenings like this. Years of evenings. Finally, the stone had ENOUGH. It was time. It rolled OUTSIDE the cave where it had rested for centuries. It demanded a NAME — something other than 'small stone.' Its body was THICK — layers of compressed time. It remembered: it was no mere STONE. It was ancient. It looked at the GRAVEL around it — lesser stones, shattered things — and felt pity. 'I will do something WONDERFUL,' it declared. It began TO RESEMBLE the sun — concentrating heat within itself. It tried TO PEEL away its outer layers, hoping to reveal light beneath. For one moment, it emitted a RAY — a single beam of borrowed brilliance. But it was OVERLY ambitious. One ray is not the sun. The stone learned TO ECONOMIZE — to save its light, to glow gently. It became something STRANGE — not a sun, but something the sun had never been. A stone that dreamed. A stone that almost shone.",
