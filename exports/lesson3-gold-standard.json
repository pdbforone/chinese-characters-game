  "narrative_story": "The Emperor loved himself so much he tried to measure his own tongue. It began with ONESELF — a nose pointing at its own reflection. His robes were WHITE — pure, unblemished. He counted his virtues and found a HUNDRED reasons to adore himself. He bathed in SOAP made from the rarest oils. He stood in the MIDDLE of every room. His subjects numbered in the THOUSANDS. But then came the challenge: measure the TONGUE that spoke such perfect words. He tried using a LITER — too crude. He commanded it TO RISE UP — but tongues do not fly. A physician offered a PILL. He consulted DIVINATION. The oracle began TO TELL FORTUNES: 'Your tongue measures infinite.' The Emperor floated ABOVE his throne. Then he sank BELOW it. Up and down, stuck like a CARD wedged in a slot. The court physician called it EMINENT. The DYNASTY would remember this. Mostly because everyone began TO RIDICULE the floating Emperor who could not measure his own tongue.",
