  "narrative_story": "Before there was music, an ancient fool with wild whiskers opened his mouth and invented singing. He was ANCIENT — older than stone, older than memory. He had been alone so long he'd forgotten why. So he acted RECKLESSLY, without thought, without plan. 'I,' he said aloud, testing the word. 'I am.' But being alone is not the same as being. He needed a COMPANION — two moons standing side by side. When the companion arrived, the darkness between them grew BRIGHT — sun and moon together. In that brightness, the ancient one opened his mouth TO SING. The first song. The sound scattered into the darkness and returned as SPARKLING light — three suns dancing. Other beings emerged, bringing GOODS — three mouths speaking, trading. The world became PROSPEROUS — two suns rising. But the singer had started too EARLY. They waited for the RISING SUN. One GENERATION passed, then another. His STOMACH growled. At DAYBREAK he finally ate. And then his hungry belly roared so loud that the earth itself bent: CONCAVE in some places, CONVEX in others. Mountains and valleys — all because an ancient fool was hungry for music.",
