# Mnemonic Story Style Guide

## Evidence-Based Principles for Chinese Character Learning

_Synthesized from cognitive science research, SLA studies, and analysis of proven memory systems_

---

## Part 1: The S.I.N.C. Protocol

Every mnemonic story must satisfy four criteria:

### S - Sensory/Self (First Person + Multimodal)

**Rule:** Write in first person. The learner must be IN the story, not observing it.

- ❌ "A man cuts the rope"
- ✅ "I grab the knife and slash through the rope"

**Why:** The Self-Reference Effect (SRE) activates the Medial Prefrontal Cortex, creating more stable and accessible memory traces. First-person memories are more vivid and emotionally intense.

**Multimodal Engagement:** Engage 2-3 senses minimum:

- Visual (what you see)
- Auditory (what you hear - especially the pinyin sound)
- Kinesthetic (what you feel/do)
- Olfactory/Gustatory (smell/taste - use sparingly for high impact)

---

### I - Interaction (Transitive Verbs, Not Adjacency)

**Rule:** Components must ACT ON each other, not merely exist side-by-side.

- ❌ "The sun and the moon are next to each other"
- ✅ "The sun CRASHES into the moon, and they FUSE into blinding light"

**Why:** Interaction creates a unitary memory trace. Static descriptions create fragmented, disconnected images that decay independently.

**Verb Priority:** Use violent, kinetic verbs:

- SMASH, CRUSH, STAB, SLASH, EXPLODE
- DEVOUR, SWALLOW, CONSUME
- GRAB, YANK, RIP, TEAR

---

### N - Negative Valence (NEVER Model)

**Rule:** Use destruction, theft, violence, or taboo elements.

**Why:** The NEVER model (Negative Emotional Valence Enhances Recapitulation) shows that negative emotions trigger the amygdala to enhance visual cortex activity, creating higher-resolution memory of specific details. Since Chinese characters differ by single strokes, this precision is critical.

**Calibration:**

- The shocking element must be INTEGRAL to the component interaction
- "Plausible bizarre" > "Impossible bizarre" (easier to mentally simulate)
- Violence should serve the mnemonic, not overwhelm it

**Warning:** In a corpus of 3,035 bizarre stories, bizarreness loses distinctiveness (Von Restorff effect). Use REPULSION between similar characters to maintain distinctiveness.

---

### C - Chunking (≤20 Words, ≤4 Elements)

**Rule:** Maximum 3-4 distinct "chunks" per story. Maximum 15-20 words.

**Why:** Working memory capacity is 3-4 chunks without rehearsal. Stories exceeding this fragment and decay.

**Structure:** One or two simple sentences (Subject-Verb-Object). Avoid:

- Complex clauses
- Non-functional adjectives
- Decorative elaboration

---

## Part 2: The Tone-Emotion System (Revised)

Based on research into L2 tone acquisition, the original system requires modifications:

### Tone 1 (55 - High Level): "SINGING"

- **Valid:** High alignment with research
- **Emotion:** Sustained, cheerful, operatic
- **Gesture:** Flat horizontal hand at forehead level
- **Color:** Blue (sky/high)
- **Voice quality:** Sustained, no declination
- **Risk:** English speakers let it fall. "Singing" forces sustain.

### Tone 2 (35 - Rising): "SURPRISED" ⚠️

- **REVISED:** Changed from "Questioning" to avoid L1 interference
- **Emotion:** Surprised, startled (NOT questioning)
- **Gesture:** Sharp upward shrug ("Huh?!")
- **Color:** Green (growing/rising)
- **Voice quality:** Energy rising, like a gasp
- **Critical Warning:** Do NOT associate with syntactic questions. Drill T2 in statements.

### Tone 3 (214 → 21 - Low): "ZOMBIE/RUMBLING" ⚠️

- **REVISED:** Changed from "Dipping" to "Low/Creaky"
- **Emotion:** Zombie groan, low rumble, creaky
- **Gesture:** Hand sinks low, palm down
- **Color:** Brown/Black (earth/low)
- **Voice quality:** Creaky voice (vocal fry), bottom of range
- **Critical:** In connected speech, T3 is almost never a full dip. It's just LOW.

### Tone 4 (51 - Falling): "COMMANDING"

- **Valid:** High alignment with L1 stress patterns
- **Emotion:** Angry command, karate chop, decisive
- **Gesture:** Sharp downward chop
- **Color:** Red (anger/force)
- **Voice quality:** Sharp, explosive, short duration

### Tone 5 (Neutral): "MUMBLED"

- **Emotion:** Afterthought, unstressed, throwaway
- **Gesture:** Loose hand wave
- **Color:** Gray
- **Voice quality:** Reduced, attached to previous syllable

## Part 3: Phonetic Component Rules

~80% of characters are phonetic-semantic compounds. Use these patterns:

### Gold Standard Phonetic Sets (Near 100% Reliable)

Use these as anchors in mnemonics:

| Component | Pinyin | Derivatives (all same sound) |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 皇        | huáng  | 煌, 惶, 蝗, 篁, 潢           |
| 希        | xī     | 稀, 烯, 唏, 浠               |
| 昌        | chāng  | 猖, 娼, 鲳, 菖               |
| 里        | lǐ     | 理, 鲤, 俚, 锂               |
| 式        | shì    | 试, 拭, 轼                   |
| 冈        | gāng   | 刚, 钢, 纲                   |

### Sound Shift Rules (Predictable Irregularities)

**1. Velar Palatalization (G/K/H → J/Q/X before i/ü)**

- 工 (gōng) → 江 (jiāng): G became J before i
- Mnemonic: "Hard sounds SOFTEN before 'ee' sounds"

**2. Labial Split (B/P ↔ F)**

- Historical: No "F" existed; it evolved from P/B
- Pattern: B/P phonetics may indicate F words

**3. Entering Tone Chaos (Random Tone Distribution)**

- Characters ending in -p, -t, -k in Middle Chinese scattered randomly
- **Red Flag:** If a phonetic series has all 4 tones, abandon phonetic prediction
- Example: 复 series (fù, fú, fù) - just memorize individually

### False Friends (Traps to Avoid)

| Looks Like          | Actually                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 良 (liáng) with dot | Different from 艮 (gèn) without dot            |
| 没 (méi)            | Unrelated to 设 (shè) despite shared component |
| 采 (cǎi)            | Sometimes semantic, not phonetic               |

**Mnemonic Strategy:** When a phonetic is reliable, MENTION it in the story. When it's a false friend, explicitly WARN in the story.

---

## Part 4: Interference Prevention

With 3,035 characters, interference is the primary threat.

### Similar Character Protocol (REPULSION)

When two characters look similar (日/目, 八/入, 己/已/巳):

1. **Teach together** with explicit contrast
2. **Encode the difference** in both stories
3. **Use opposite imagery:**
   - 日 (one line) = "ONE sun, ONE bar of light"
   - 目 (two lines) = "TWO eyelids blinking"

### Spatial Scaffolding (Method of Loci Integration)

For lesson-level coherence:

- Each lesson = One "palace" (location)
- Each character = One "station" within that palace
- Characters interact with room features

**Example:** Lesson 1 (Numbers) could be set in a casino:

- 一 at the entrance (single door)
- 二 at the blackjack table (double down)
- 三 at the slot machines (three reels)

### The "Ghosting" Problem

If you reuse locations, old images "ghost" and interfere.

- **Solution:** Each lesson gets a UNIQUE location
- 112 lessons = 112 distinct palaces

---

## Part 5: Tone Sandhi in Stories

### Third Tone Sandhi (3-3 → 2-3)

**Rule:** When two T3 words are adjacent, the first becomes T2.

**Mnemonic Framing:** "Two zombies (T3) can't stand together. One has to wake up (become surprised/T2) to make room."

**In Practice:** When writing stories for T3 words that commonly pair with other T3 words, note the sandhi in the story.

### 一 (yī) and 不 (bù) Sandhi

**Lexicalization Rule:** Don't teach rules; teach chunks.

- Teach 一個 (yígè) as a unit, not 一 + rule
- Teach 不是 (búshì) as a unit, not 不 + rule

---

## Part 6: Story Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any mnemonic, verify:

### Structure

- [ ] ≤20 words
- [ ] ≤4 distinct chunks/elements
- [ ] First person perspective ("I")
- [ ] Transitive verb (action ON something)

### Sensory

- [ ] Visual element present
- [ ] Sound element present (ideally the pinyin approximation)
- [ ] One additional sense (touch, smell, taste)

### Emotional

- [ ] Negative valence OR strong positive (not neutral)
- [ ] Shocking element integral to the interaction
- [ ] Emotionally distinct from similar characters

### Phonetic

- [ ] Tone verb matches tone number (sing/surprised/zombie/command)
- [ ] Sound bridge uses accurate approximation (Q=chee, X=she, Z=dz)
- [ ] If phonetic component is reliable, it's mentioned
- [ ] If phonetic component is a trap, it's warned

### Distinctiveness

- [ ] If similar to another character, REPULSION is encoded
- [ ] Story is distinct enough to not interfere with neighbors
- [ ] Spatial location assigned (if using palace system)

## Part 7: The "Pithy Formula" Format

Each character should have a compressed "core" (8-12 words) that captures:

1. The visual/component logic
2. The sound approximation
3. The tone emotion

**Template:**
"[COMPONENT IMAGERY] [TONE-VERB] '[SOUND]!' [OUTCOME/ACTION]"

**Examples:**

- 木 (mù, T4): "I CHOP the tree and it COMMANDS 'MOO!' as it crashes down."
- 明 (míng, T2): "Sun SLAMS into moon—I gasp 'MING?!' at the blinding flash."
- 五. (wǔ, T3): "Five fingers curl into a fist, GROANING 'Wuuuu' from the grave."

---

## Part 8: Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Passive Observation

"The character shows a tree" → No action, no engagement

### ❌ Abstract Description

"This represents the concept of brightness" → Not concrete, not memorable

### ❌ Keyword Synonyms

Using "warm" for one character and "warmth" for another → Synaptic interference

### ❌ Sound Without Tone

"It sounds like 'ma'" → Which tone? The tone IS the word.

### ❌ Decorative Bizarreness

"A purple elephant wearing a top hat" → Bizarre but not interactive or integral

### ❌ Over-Elaboration

50+ word stories with nested clauses → Exceeds working memory, fragments

### ❌ Third Person Distance

"The warrior attacks" → Less memorable than "I attack"
