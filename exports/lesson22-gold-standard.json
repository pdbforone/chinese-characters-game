  "title": "The Hand's Journey",
  "theme": "Saga: Craft",
  "narrative_story": "The hand woke before dawn. It looked at its fingers, ready to hold whatever the day demanded. 'I am more than flesh,' it thought. Righteousness required deliberation—even the smallest ant understood this. The hand learned to embrace and to combat. It could criticize or beckon. Sometimes it needed to strike, to point the finger, to support the weak. It would include everything, bring up concerns, brandish warnings, push forward, welcome newcomers. It could hang things carefully, press down firmly, drop nothing by accident. It pulled when needed, exclaimed in triumph, looked for solutions. It would grind away at problems, play with possibilities. Even the nose knew the hand's importance. Punishment awaited the hand that broke the mold. Genius brought riches when deposited at the right place. Only then could the hand give milk, catch up with others, inhale deeply. History showed that even more hardness awaited. Again and again, the hand found friends. A pair worked together, each one of the pair protecting, seizing opportunity. The hand learned to observe with joy, to throw accurately, never lacking. It established patterns on the thigh, like an offshoot showing skill. Each branch of knowledge was passed from uncle to superintendent, even in loneliness. Against all odds, the plank held. The hand could go back, join any faction, feel its own blood vessels pulse. With claw ready to grab, it would pluck, pick vegetables, accept whatever was conferred. Love made the hand grand. From its platform it would govern, commence each task, go forward by any method. Until the room was reached, it would arrive at mutual understanding. Sufficient education would flow like water combing through tangles.",
