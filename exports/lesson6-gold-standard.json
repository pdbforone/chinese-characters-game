But he was still a CHILD — small, incomplete, full of potential. He discovered a CAVITY in the garden wall — an opening to a world his parents didn't control. Through that hole, he learned TO ROAR. Not a cry. Not a whimper. A roar. His parents wish they had stoppED him earlier. But completion comes too late. His mother was a WOMAN of patience. Bent gracefully, like water around stone. She believed he would become GOOD — woman and child together, in harmony. 'You'll grow TO BE LIKE your brother,' she promised. 'Strong. Respected.' The MOTHER fed him, clothed him, endured him. But this child had no interest in being like anyone. He wanted TO PIERCE through expectations. His ELDER BROTHER — the one from the Workshop of Blades — tried to teach him discipline. The child watched, roared, and learned TO OVERCOME every obstacle they placed before him. Not by obedience. By force of will.",
