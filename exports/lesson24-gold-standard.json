Her covering was broken by stones. Under a quilt, she lay malicious in death. They lined up in intense formation to bury the body. The ear took note of every sound. Most took interest in the holy job. The brave faced strict judgment. The proceedings were drawn out, slow, overflowing with grief. A ring was returned to the husband who followed regulations. The replacement for the lost official was about to arrive. The worthy stood firm with power. Another warned: don't turn away. The male achieved glory while the slave toiled. They added congratulations on the shelf. Ten cooperated in the line of business. The law decreed recovery. One must treat others as they walk toward morality. Listen in the hall for the tiny sounds on the street.",
