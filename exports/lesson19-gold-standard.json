  "narrative_story": "The blind fortune-teller demanded compensation. For years she had cultivated her gift—the ability to hear sound in the dark. She spoke in rhymes, her knowledge marked by streamers hanging from her tent. Unexpectedly, she produced a mirror. 'This shows the boundary between worlds,' she said. 'The deceased appear here.' The blind see what the sighted cannot. Her predictions were never absurd. People came expecting answers. She pointed in every direction. 'You hinder your own path,' she told one man. 'Release your anger.' Her words excited visitors. 'At this location, beside you,' she whispered, 'stand the ghosts.' She would convert grief into acceptance. Some undressed their souls completely. She spoke of what was formerly hidden. Her power increased daily. She gave presents of prophecy. From the east, from every building, people came. Even those frozen with fear sought her wisdom.",
