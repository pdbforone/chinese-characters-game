  "narrative_story": "The Tao (Way) is usually peaceful, but today it involves a speedy car chase. The Way stretched forward, endless and true. A guide appeared to lead travelers through its mysteries. But today required something speedy. Someone had begun to create chaos along the path. Guards were sent to patrol the roads. Others preferred to stroll—too slow for today. Then came the car—wooden wheels screaming on stone. One after another they appeared, chasing something precious. A lotus flower had been stolen from the temple. The thief was in front, wielding shears. The guards tried to transport themselves faster. Their speed began to exceed what was safe. Each driver had their own pattern of madness. A guest from the capital joined the chase, his forehead gleaming with sweat. It was summer—the hottest day of the year. Someone mentioned L.A.—a distant city where such chases were common. The lotus thief began to fall behind. The way is peaceful. But sometimes the way requires speed.",
