  "narrative_story": "She found herself trapped, the walls solid around her. This country was round like a prison. The cause of her suffering was the park she could see but not enter. She wanted to return, to revolve through the gates again. She stared at the picture of freedom on the wall. In the store below, a warehouse stored trousers. The factory workers slept on narrow beds. Hemp rope bound their hands. Her heart would not forget. She learned to endure, to recognize her situation. Her aspiration was recorded in secret annals. She considered every option. The idea came to her: she would think her way out. Each breath brought new plans. She learned to fear less. She could feel the change coming. Her only regret was the time lost. She grew worried but would not dread the future. She stayed busy, became accustomed to hardship. She learned to cherish small victories. She would certainly escape.",
