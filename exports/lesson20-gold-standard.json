  "narrative_story": "In the garden, she also tended the ground. By the pond, insects swarmed. A serpent emerged from its egg. The wind seemed to mock her efforts. She looked at herself and knew she must alter her approach. She would remember what she had already learned. She began to wrap seeds in leaves. Bubbles rose from the pond as she began her work. Her house overlooked the site where she made soup from the sheep. The animals were beautiful. The ocean lay beyond, fresh and vast. She hoped to reach it someday. The appearance of the garden would fall short of perfection—she knew that. Birds gathered in the trees. She watched them advance across the sky. Her standard was high. 'Who would come to see this?' she wondered. She could vend the vegetables, although nothing was reliable yet. At noon she would permit herself rest. Feathers drifted down. Young birds learned to soar above the garden of beasts.",
